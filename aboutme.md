:telescope: ![Custom badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-MOTIVATIONS-yellowgreen.svg) I like to work on
interesting and challenging software engineering problems. My current research is focused
on [software diversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_diversity),
[automatic program debloating](https://cesarsotovalero.github.io/2018-09-24-program-debloating)
and [software specialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-time_algorithm_specialisation).

the beautiful parks in Stockholm.
