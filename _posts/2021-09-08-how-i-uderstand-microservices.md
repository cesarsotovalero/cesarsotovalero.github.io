Use depclean web as an example of microservices by intuition

Everything is data going around

The rise of the

Web monolith vs microservices

The DevOps revolution

Small applications that talk to each other over the rest api

Microservices are poligloth system

Works well with containers

Scale, saves money

Increase complexity, overhead

Resilience, if one service fail the system can recover

Facilitates orchestration

Ddd

Hiding implementation details

Be careful with the data exposed

Good Api documentation is crucial for the api consumer

Microservices are especially suited to loosely couple problems

# depClean-web

[depclean-web](https://github.com/castor-software/depclean-web)
DepClean Web is an interactive website visualization that allows a user to input the URL of a Java project and receive the analysis output of DepClean.
The backend service detects all the unused dependencies declared in the pom.xml file of the project and sends them to the front for visualization as an interactive web site.
