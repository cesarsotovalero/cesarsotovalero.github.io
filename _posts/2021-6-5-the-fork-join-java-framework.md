The [Fork/Join](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/forkjoin.html) framework facilitate Java programmers to take advantage of parallel execution supported by multicore processors.
This API is in the `java.util.concurrent` package since JDK 7, and it has been improved in subsequent version of the JDK.
It allows the user to forget about the heavy-duty tasks associated with the handling of threads manually.
With Fork/Join, threads are created and managed automatically, while taking advantage of the computational power or multiple processors. 
This post discusses the key aspects of this framework from a practical perspective.

# Concurrency vs. Parallelism

First, let's differentiate the concepts of concurrent and parallel execution in the context of a Java application. 

- **Concurrent execution:** All the threads are executed on the same CPU. This means that the application does not make progress on more than one task at the same time, i.e., the tasks are executed in interleave fashion, sharing CPU processing time during execution.
- **Parallel execution:** Each thread is executed in a separate CPU core. Therefore, tasks make progress independently. This allows the execution to make progress on more than one task simultaneously.

To achieve parallelism, the Java application must have more than one thread running, and each thread must run on separate CPU, CPU cores, GPUs, or similar.

# The Fork/Join framework

Fork/Join framework is a set of APIs that facilitate Java programmers simplifies the implementation of parallel programming tasks in Java.
The Fork/Join pool framework supports a style of parallel programming that solves problems through the "divide and conquer" strategy. 
In its recursive approach, a problem is split into smaller independent parts, which in turn, the small part is split further until each part can be solved directly (this is called **fork**). 
Then, all parts are executed and solved in parallel. 
Once completed, all the results are **joined** together to produce the final output.
The following pseudocode describes the process:

{% highlight text linenos %}
if (my portion of the work is small enough)
  solve the problem directly (sequential algorithm)
else
  split the problem into independent parts
  fork new sub-tasks to solve each part
  join all sub-tasks
  compose the result from sub-results
{% endhighlight %}

There are four classes that you need to know about to use the framework:

- `ForkJoinPool`: An executor dedicated to run instances implementing `ForkJoinTask<V>`. Implements the **work stealing algorithm** to balance the load among threads: if a worker thread runs out of things to do, it can steal tasks from other threads that are still busy.
- `ForkJoinTask<V>`: An abstract class that defines a task that runs within a `ForkJoinPool`.
- `RecursiveAction`:  A `ForkJoinTask` subclass for tasks that donâ€™t return values.
- `RecursiveTask<V>`: A `ForkJoinTask` subclass for tasks that return values.

In practice, you only need to extend either `RecursiveAction` or `RecursiveTask<V>`, and override the abstract method `compute()`. Then,  submit the task to be executed by the `ForkJoinPool`,  which handles everything from threads management to utilization of multicore processor. Note that `RecursiveAction` do not return anything, while the `RecursiveTask<V>` can return object of specified type. If you want to look deeper, here is the class diagram of this architecture.

# Examples

Let's consider two illustrative examples to illustrate how you can use the Fork/Join framework.  

#### RecursiveAction

You want to replace the value of all the entries of a particular element in an array of integers.
There may be more than one entry of the same element in the array.
This task is suitable for implementing in parallel because the array can be split to replace the element in each part independently. 
The following `ForkJoinReplaceAction` class presents the solution. 
The method `compute()` is `void`. It calls the `process()` method that replaces the element in the array when the splitted part is smaller than the specified `THRESHOLD`. Otherwise, it calls the static `invokeAll` method in the `ForkJoinTask` class with a list of instances of the `ForkJoinReplaceAction` in which the array is divided in a half.

{% highlight java linenos %}
public class ForkJoinReplaceAction extends RecursiveAction {
  private final int element;
  private final int[] array;
  private final int THRESHOLD;
  private final int ini;
  private final int end;

  // AllArgs Constructor

  @Override
  protected void compute() {
    if (end - ini <= THRESHOLD) {
      process(element, array, ini, end);
    } else {
      ForkJoinTask.invokeAll(createSubTasks());
    }
  }

  private List<ForkJoinReplaceAction> createSubTasks() {
    List<ForkJoinReplaceAction> taskList = new ArrayList<>();
    taskList.add(
        new ForkJoinReplaceAction(element, array, THRESHOLD, ini, (ini + end) / 2)
    );
    taskList.add(
        new ForkJoinReplaceAction(element, array, THRESHOLD, (ini + end) / 2, end)
    );
    return taskList;
  }
  
  private void process(int element, int[] array, int ini, int end) {
    for (int i = ini; i < end; i++) {
      if (array[i] == element) {
        array[i] = -1;
      }
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

To execute the `ForkJoinReplaceAction`, create an instance of `ForkJoinPool` and use the `invoke()` method, as follows:

{% highlight java linenos %}
ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
int[] arr = new int[]{1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7};
pool.invoke(new ForkJoinReplaceAction(3, arr, 2, 0, arr.length));
Arrays.stream(arr).forEach(value -> System.out.print(value + " "));
{% endhighlight %}


#### RecursiveTask<V>


{% highlight java linenos %}
public class ForkJoinCountTask extends RecursiveTask<Integer> {
  private final int element;
  private final int[] array;
  private final int THRESHOLD;
  private final int ini;
  private final int end;

  // AllArgs Constructor
  
  @Override
  protected Integer compute() {
    if (end - ini <= THRESHOLD) {
      return process(element, array, ini, end);
    } else {
    return ForkJoinTask.invokeAll(createSubTasks())
      .stream()
      .mapToInt(ForkJoinTask::join)
      .sum();
    }
  }
  
  private List<ForkJoinCountTask> createSubTasks() {
    List<ForkJoinCountTask> taskList = new ArrayList<>();
    taskList.add(new ForkJoinCountTask(element, array, THRESHOLD, ini, (ini + end) / 2));
    taskList.add(new ForkJoinCountTask(element, array, THRESHOLD, (ini + end) / 2, end));
    return taskList;
  }
  
  private Integer process(int element, int[] array, int ini, int end) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = ini; i < end; i++) {
      if (array[i] == element) {
        count++;
      }
    }
    return count;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight java linenos %}
var pool = new ForkJoinPool();
int[] arr = new int[]{1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7};
System.out.println(pool.invoke(new ForkJoinCountTask(3, arr, 2, 0, arr.length)));
{% endhighlight %}
