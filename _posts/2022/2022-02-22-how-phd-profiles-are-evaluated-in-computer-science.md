description: For those who decided to stay in academia, achieving a position as a tenured professor is not easy, to say the least. There are several evaluation layers to pass before reaching this position, so it is better to be prepared. Research profiles are be carefully evaluated before being accepted or rejected, so it is better for you to prepare well for what is coming.

You just finished your PhD and decided to stay in academia.
Typically, the next move is applying for a new ~~temporally~~ position as PostDoc.
At this point, you want to get a PostDoc leading to the “tenured track” so that you can eventually become an assistant professor.
But hold on because you are about to jump into one of academia's deepest and most competitive waters (i.e., the hyper-competitiveness for tenured positions).
To succeed in this endeavor and get on the “track,” you should have a publication profile that is appealing to the academic recruiters.
But even if you have a ton of impactful publications, research experience and talent are not enough.
You also need teaching experience that demonstrates that you can perform well as a professor and scientist simultaneously.
I think that if your goal is to stay in academia, it is better to anticipate all this and plan for it during your PhD studies.
So, at the end of the PhD your profile will be rigorously evaluated.
Let's be prepared!

# The Goal

After finishing a PhD studies, there are basically two different career directions to follow: (1) staying in academia or (2) moving to the industry.
The simplified career paths look like this:

e[Become an Assistant Professor] --> f[Become an Tenured Professor];
{% endmermaid %}

Once you decide to stay in academia, the natural goal is to become a tenured professor.
But achieving this goal is not easy, to say the least.
It will take about ten years to get (≈4 to 6 years as PostDoc + ≈5 to 6 years as Assistant Professor).
The success or failure of this endeavor depends on many variables.
Some of them are under your control, such as your research performance, but other depends on luck and the impact of your contributions.
For example, if you are into Theoretical Computer Science, then it is more difficult to get a large number of good publications during your time as a researcher.
This is true, especially when compared to other fields, such as Machine Learning, where there is more opportunity to develop multidisciplinary research that can lead to more publications.

Overall, the performance of researchers is tough to measure and evaluate.
This is an inherent problem of the research job, and there is nothing we can do about it.
But everyone agrees that success in academia is based on **prestige** and **networking**.
The prestige is often obtained through impactful publications, and it can be roughly measured with some bibliometric variables.
There are several metrics that attempt to rank researchers, more notably citations count and [H-index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index).
There is also other metrics that consider the teaching experience: the number of supervised students, courses taught, etc.
On the other hand, networking determines the chances to meet the “right people,” i.e., the already established professors you may contact in the future when seeking opportunities.
Networking is typically achieved at conferences, by delivering technical talks, or by visiting other research departments.

# Getting Prepared 

There are just no workarounds when choosing the academic career path.
You have to go through the well-known process by working hard and being consistent.
Better be prepared because a researcher might is evaluated several times along her career.
So the best one can do is to be prepared in advance in order to pass the distinct evaluation layers as painlessly as possible.

## From PhD Student to PostDoc

At this stage, you may be lucky because PostDoc candidates in Computer Science are scarce.
After graduation, many PhD students move to the industry, motivated by the much higher economic revenue received when working in IT companies.
Therefore, after graduating with a PhD, getting a position as PostDoc is typically not very difficult.
Basically, all you need is a good publication profile with at least 3 strong published papers and the ability to communicate your research very well.
These are two skills that you have supposedly acquired during your PhD studies.

These are the general steps to becoming a PostDoc:

1. Identify the research teams that work on similar topics as you do.
2. Submit your profile and statement of interest directly to head researchers in those institutions.
3. Prepare for an interview (a coding exercise is probably not mandatory).
4. Present your research expertise and agenda.

## From PostDoc to Assistant Professor

At this step is when everything starts becoming more challenging.
An Assistant Professor should be a talented researcher and a good teacher.
Therefore, at this point, you should have demonstrable teaching and research experience to put in your resume.
The evaluation of PostDoc candidates is typically done by experienced professors and approved by their institutions.
Look at some examples as follows.

Qualification for Associate Professor in France:
- Review done by the [CNU](https://conseil-national-des-universites.fr/cnu/#/) (Conseil national des universités), a national consultative and decision-making body.
- Divided into 78 sections (Computer Science, Math, Philosophy, etc.).
- Each section is composed of Associate Professors from French universities.
- The Computer Science section currently has 97 members.

Qualification for Associate Professor in Spain:
- Review by a governmental agencies: nacional ([ANECA](http://www.aneca.es/)) and regionals.
- ANECA: (The National Agency for Quality Assessment and Accreditation of Spain) autonomous body whose aim is to provide external quality assurance for the Spanish Higher Education System and to contribute to its constant improvement through evaluation, certification and accreditation.
- Member of [ENQA](https://www.enqa.eu/) (The European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education).

## From Assistant Professor to Tenured Professor

To get Tenured Professor, you not only need good bibliometrics (i.e., a good number of publications), teaching experience, and supervision experience.
You also need proof of your ability to attack funding from public institutions (i.e., research grants) and demonstrated leadership at successful research projects.
Here are some examples of must-needed qualifications.

Qualification for Tenured Professor in France:
- Candidate sends the Dossier (CV).
- CNU Section computer science assigns reviewers.
- The reviewers judge the quality of the PhD thesis, publications, and the number of teaching duties done.

Qualification for Tenured Professor in Sweden:
- [UKÄ](https://www.uka.se/) (Swedish Higher Education Authority) is an independent government agency in Sweden. Its operations comprise three main areas:
- Quality assurance of higher education and research, and appraisal of the degree-awarding powers of public-sector higher education institutions.
- Legal supervision of higher education.
- Monitoring efficiency, follow-up and horizon scanning as well as responsibility for statistics in the higher education sector.

# Other Career Paths for Researchers

I want to mention that researcher is somebody who actively does research, including:

- A PhD
- A PostDoc
- An Assistant Professor
- A Tenured Professor
- _A PhD working in a research institution_
- _A PhD working in R&D at a company_

Therefore, if you have a strong passion for research and don't like teaching, then there are other ways to be a researcher outside academia.

# Conclusion

Given that you have enough passion for your field and the determination to continue in academia, you should know that the job can be a holy grail, but only after you get tenure.
Unfortunately, there is a long way to go before reaching this sublime state.
Before that, candidates must go through a long path full of competitiveness and work uncertainty.
This situation simply obeys the market laws: the demand for these positions is higher than the offer.
So, now that you know... if you still want it, then go for it!
