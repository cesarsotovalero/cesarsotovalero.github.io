# Researcher

Researcher: Somebody that actively does research, including:
- A PhD after graduation
- An assistant professor
- A full professor
- Graduated from PhD working at research institution

# Evaluation of a researcher

Beyond the applications for a research and teaching position (including academia e.g., Tenure Track), a researcher can be evaluated several times along her/his career.

Examples:
- Qualification for being eligible for a candidature of university professor
- Promotions (e.g., after her/his tenure)
- Salary bonus (e.g., for distinguished research)
- Funding evaluations (e.g., ERC)

Qualification for being eligible for a candidature of university professor
Required in different European countries
- France: Qualification MdC/Professeur
- Spain: ANECA, AQU
- Italy: VQR and ASN (National Scientific Accreditation)
- Etc.

**Question:** Is a qualification required in Sweden?

Different evaluation methods, including
- Review by peers
- Agencies

Example of Qualification for (assistant/associate/full) professor in France
- Review done by the CNU (Conseil national des universités)
- CNU is a national consultative and decision-making body
- Divided in 78 sections (Computer Science, Math, Philosophy, etc)
- Each section is composed by associate and professors from French universities
  - The Computer Science section currently has 97 members

Example of Qualification for (assistant/associate/full) professor in Spain:
- Review by a governmental agencies: nacional (ANECA) and regionals
- ANECA: (The National Agency for Quality Assessment and Accreditation of Spain) autonomous body whose aim is to provide external quality assurance for the Spanish Higher Education System and to contribute to its constant improvement through evaluation, certification and accreditation
- Member of ENQA (The European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education)

# Review by peers

Example of Qualification for (assistant/associate/full) professor in France

Evaluation process:
1. Candidate sends the Dossier (CV)
2. CNU Section computer science assigns X reviewers (usually X=2)
3. the reviewers judge the quality of the PhD thesis, publications, and the number of teaching duties done

# Swedish agency

UKÄ (Swedish Higher Education Authority) is an independent government agency in Sweden. Its operations comprise three main areas:
- quality assurance of higher education and research, and appraisal of the degree-awarding powers of public-sector higher education institutions;
- legal supervision of higher education;
- monitoring efficiency, follow-up and horizon scanning as well as responsibility for statistics in the higher education sector.

# Reviewed by agencies

Example of Qualification for (assistant/associate/full) professor in Spain
- Review by a governmental agencies: nacional (ANECA) and regionals
- Accreditation from ANECA is based on bibliometrics

# Problematic

Both evaluation method (based on peers and bibliometrics) have pros and cons.
In the following seminars, we will discuss further on those issues
Next episode: The business behind Bibliometrics
To be continued…
