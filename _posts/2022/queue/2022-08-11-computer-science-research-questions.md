> Ideas are cheap, show me the paper.

I have been collecting random software engineering research ideas from friends and colleagues for more than a decade. 
These are the questions I’ve been asked since I started taking notes ten years ago. 
I apologize for not keeping track of who wanted to know, but if you’re working on any of these, please get in touch and I’ll try to track them down.

The questions are not in any specific order and they cover a wide range of topics.

# Addressed by Me

1. How to automatically remove dependencies from a software system using static analysis?
2. 

# Open Questions

1. Do we remove more by compressing a project than what we do by debloating it?
