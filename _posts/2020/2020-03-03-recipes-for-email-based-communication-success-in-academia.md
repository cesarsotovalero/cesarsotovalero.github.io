You cannot be a good researchers without being a good communicator. 
If you are good enough at both, they you may qualify for becoming a supervisor.
Being a good academic supervisor is a matter of practice, discipline, and the development of leading skills. 
Handling tons of emails is the everyday bread and butter for those who have reached this level of success (i.e., supervising other people). 

In this post, I'll illustrate how using a template based approach to easing email management can boost productivity and improve the quality of this communication channel.

<p>
Hi XXX,<br/>
<br/>
Nice to meet you.
<br/>
As a starting point for our conversation, I would like to know more about you.<br/>
* What's your best research writing achievement (report, dissertation, paper)? (please send it to me)<br/>
* What's your best programming achievement (explain the domain, programming language, software stack, role in the team)?<br/>
* What accomplishments are you most proud of?<br/>
* What's your biggest failure?<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,
XXX

<details><summary>Assigning a technical task</summary>
Hi XXX,<br/>
<br/>
Now I'd like to give you a technical task.<br/>
<br/>
Your task is XXX.<br/>
<br/>
The task is deliberately very open because this is how research works. In case of problems (and there will be some), don't hesitate to make simplifying assumptions in order to achieve something meaningful.<br/>
<br/>
Then, I ask you to write a short document explaining the outcome of this task and your reflection on it. If you're not successful, you can reflect about the main difficulties you faced.<br/>
<br/>
When could you send me this document?<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
XXX

<details><summary>Asking review and feedback</summary>
<p>
Hi XXX,<br/>
<br/>
I hope your review to be almost-comically brutal.
<br/>
Best regards,
XXX

<details><summary>Dissemination of thesis work</summary>
Hi [STUDENT],<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations on successfully passing your [B.Sc./M.Sc] thesis.<br/>
<br/>
Your thesis results are worth spreading, and I'm therefore checking here your interest in getting an article published in an international software engineering journal or with the possibility to participate in an international conference to present it on behalf of [UNIVERSITY].<br/>
<br/>
I think there is a chance of getting your work published with a bit of extra work (this could be a nice merit for your CV) for instance, if you're considering applying to an R&D department at a larger software company (or considering pursuing a doctorate further down the line!) you will be well positioned compared to other BSc graduates and even MSc graduates who haven't published.
<br/>
I would appreciate if you could respond with one of the following options:

1. Sounds interesting! I want to hear more; can we have a meeting?
2. No interest, but you can proceed with it. Then I will work on the text if time/possibility allows, and you will be co-authors. There's a chance that I might not do it, and if I do it, there will likely be some questions along the way.
3. No interest, and I do not want my work to be extended and adjusted by MIUN staff at all for publication.
<br/>

Best regards,<br/>
XXX
