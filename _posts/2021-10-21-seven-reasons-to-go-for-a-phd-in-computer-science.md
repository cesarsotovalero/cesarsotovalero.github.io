Pursuing a Ph.D. it is unique experience.
It turns out to be different for everyone.
Admittedly, it is a journey ~~mostly~~ driven by personal ambitions and self proud.
The decision to start this journey (i.e., becoming a Ph.D. student) is a very serious one.
A Ph.D. can literally change your life.
Thus, it is not something to be taken lightly considering that, to complete a Ph.D., a person normal spends 4 or 5 of her most productive years.
That's why it is important to have at least a pretty clear reason in mind before heading down this particular career path.
As with everything else, **really** knowing what you **really** want and **why** you want it is the foundation for future success in any personal endeavour.
In the case of Computer Science, a Ph.D. trains you to be a scientist, not a programmer.
This single fact has profound repercussions.
After being a Ph.D. for almost three years now, I can think of seven clear reasons that worth taking the decision to go for a Ph.D. in this field.
For Convenience, I've grouped them into the good and the ugly.
The good ones (3) aim to achieve noble goals, while the ugly ones (4) are driven by personal ambitions.
I dare to say that if you don't feel identified with any of them, then probably a Ph.D. in Computer Science is not for you.
Let's discuss this matter!

# The Good 

## 1️⃣ Feed Your Intellectual Curiosity 

A Ph.D. is an [academic degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy) given as a recognition to those who expand the boundaries of human knowledge in some specific area.
Suppose you have a curious mind and are interested in diving deep into a particular technology. In that case, a Ph.D. is an excellent opportunity to satisfy your intellectual curiosity while making significant contributions.
Researching in Computer Science is particularly exciting because software technology moves faster than other areas of science.
Every day, a new programming language is being created, a new paradigm or methodology is proposed, a new piece of open-source software is released, etc.
The feeling of being at the forefront of such a technological revolution may be gratifying.

In contrast with the rest of the educational degrees, you will be paid to research something you're interested in.
This allows experimenting with cutting-edge technology while receiving adequate funding to do so.
Learning about advanced topics and performing research experiments demands a considerable amount of time.
A Ph.D. is one of the few opportunities in life in which one officially has the time to invest in such things.
Research is a creative activity, and it's fine if some experiment doesn't give you the expected results.
You're allowed to fail, to a certain extent.
This is a position that can hardly be found when working in the industry, where the market pressure favors rapid development and well-established technologies.

In Computer Science, there are distinct levels of understanding.
Knowing how to compile a piece of code is not the same as understanding how the code is compiled.
Understanding a compiler is different from developing a new technique to make it efficient, and this is in turn different from creating a new and better compiler.
A Ph.D. is a unique opportunity to dive deep to understand how some particular technology works, at the very minimum level of detail, and make a significant contribution to it.
If you possess this urge to learn and experiment, and at the same time, dream about making a difference in the world, then a Ph.D. will give you a chance to pursue such sublime goals.

## 2️⃣ Become a Professional Researcher

The principal objective of a Ph.D. is to train students to become professional researchers.
There are two types of professional researchers: academic professors and industrial researchers.
The first group is tied to universities and has more freedom to pick their research topic, which explains why the research made in academia is often theoretical.
People in the second group often work at large companies and are more focused on producing practical results that could be translated into economic profit.
Getting a position as a researcher in any of these two is for many a synonym of holding a very gratifying job.

Some people love the research freedom of academia and, at the same time, enjoy teaching.
And if you want to teach at the highest level (i.e., at universities), you certainly need a Ph.D. (and more).
Many professors love doing something different from making money for a private company.
They feel happy staying in this idyllic limbo where knowledge is king.  
Furthermore, staying in academia brings other sorts of benefits.
For example, in most societies, respectable professors enjoy a privileged social status and recognition.
This allows you to reach a sense of personal fulfillment.

On the other hand, working as a researcher for a company is has its own benefits.
Being able to see a research prototype implemented and reaching customers is a unique feeling.
Software companies often have R&D departments filled with Ph.D. graduates, so if you go there, the environment should be already familiar to you.
As a plus, the salary in companies used to be higher than in academia, providing a good balance between personal and economic benefits.

## 3️⃣ Build a Career Network

As occurs with writers, there is a common belief that researchers work in very isolated environments.
This is simply not true.
A significant part of research work is about communicating your results.
To do so, Ph.D. students must learn how to get attention by appropriately targeting the right audience.
This can only be done through effectively networking with the most talented researchers in the field.

Most people in your immediate circle, excluding supervisors and teachers, will be at the same level as you in the professional hierarchy.
All of them talented Ph.D. students sharing the same high-level goals and with a similar urge to learn and experiment.
This means that you will be surrounded by an elite of students in an environment that explicitly promotes professional growth.
Also, as everyone is working in a very tiny and specific area, it's implausible to be working on the same thing.
As a result, colleagues and fellow researchers are not perceived as competitors but collaborators.

Assisting at conferences is an excellent way to perform "intellectual tourism."
There, one can interact with the cream of young researchers eager to receive attention.
Many of these guys will become successful entrepreneurs or occupy prestigious positions at big tech companies.
Others will become prestigious professors, and a very few of them will make significant contributions in your field, write world-acclaimed books, etc.

# The Ugly 

## 4️⃣ Set Yourself Apart From The Competition 

You probably want to be [more than just a programmer](https://www.cesarsotovalero.net/blog/hermit-programmers-are-dead.html), and that's great.
The Ph.D. journey will arm you with a set of technical and non-technical skills to satisfy this ambition.
There are many good developers out there, but a Ph.D. teaches you how to methodically solve complex problems, write well, and communicate with others.
Professional recruiters know very well that candidates with this combination are not common in the job market.

If you succeed to graduate you should be an expert in a particular area and, more importantly, have learned how to organize a research agenda and formulate specific research questions.
A Ph.D. prepares you well to ask questions with a high abstraction level and approach projects from a more holistic perspective than others.
These skills are difficult to learn and can only be acquired through experience.
Leveraging this as a professional advantage may set you apart from the competition, providing the foundation to start a strong career as a leader.

The technical skills allow you to become an expert in a very particular field.
Being an expert positions yourself as someone more valuable, and many companies are willing to pay for this particular value.
They will provide you will all you need to apply those skills as new opportunities arise, which translates into more opportunities to pursue a high-level career within the industry.
Furthermore, some particular jobs require a Ph.D. degree, i.e., many machine learning-related jobs.

## 5️⃣ Challenge Yourself

Some people are more ambitious than others (professionally speaking).
If you are very ambitious, you need to be thinking about what's beyond software development.
If you are ambitious, you might probably feel the necessity to prove yourself (and maybe others) by reaching the highest academic title available.
It may be difficult to convince someone that you are capable of creating unique technical knowledge without having published a paper.

Research offers a perfect playground for professional competition.
The whole system encourages this attitude by measuring the caliber of a researcher by its raw numbers.
For example, the number of papers, citations stats, graduated students, grants awarded, and so on.
If you can prove to be good in such a competitive environment, they are certainly among the best of the best.

Some other people feel the social pressure and avoid staying behind the people in their close network.  
For example, if all your parent and brothers hold academic titles, you'll probably feel the need to reach a similar status.
Otherwise, you might be perceived as someone that belongs to an inferior category.
However, the main driver for doing a Ph.D. should be no other than satisfying personal aspirations.

## 6️⃣ Own Your Work 

As a paid employee working in a software company, you probably have signed a contract explicitly stating that the results of your work belong to the company.
In contrast, academic research is one of the very few positions where you can personally retain all the credits for your work.
Being the owner of your work without facing the risks of being an entrepreneur is attractive.

We're all social creatures motivated by pride and vanity.
Academia is very aware of this and takes advantage of it to retain talent by leveraging personal egos.
Receiving work ownership is an incentive for which many decide to stay in academia.
The feeling of being working only for yourself is just very much appealing and hard to ignore.
Every time you publish a paper, you will read your name there and feel a sense of ownership coming from this document.
Academia gives researchers a fine reputation to live up to.
A gift for the hard work made and the comparatively low pay received in exchange for it.

## 7️⃣ Emigrate!

Everyone wants to live a good life.
But the uncomfortable truth is that the majority of people in the world have the geographical fatality of being born in countries polluted by financial uncertainty and lack of freedom.
At some point in their live, people in such poor countries realize that it is difficult (if not impossible) to live a decent life there.
Thus, the most viable solution for them is to emigrate, and doing it as a student is often one of the cleanest ways to do so.

On the other hand, science is costly.
Only the most advanced countries can afford to pay the necessary cost of performing cutting-edge research.
Professionals in Computer Science are in high demand today.
They are scarce, well paid by the industry, and also can work remotely.
This is why developed countries often lack qualified people to carry out research in this field.
The situation opens the door for talented immigrants willing to do a Ph.D. in these countries while achieving their personal goals.

Many of the Ph.D. The students from the US and Europe are talented immigrants who decided to move with their families in search of a better future.
The host country receives talented human resources to advance in the global research competition.
The students get a diploma and all the benefits of living in a highly developed country.
After graduation, as a Ph.D. owner, you probably have acquired the knowledge and skills to get a decent job in these countries.
It's a win-win situation for both parties.
