hey everybody how you doing Dylan here let's talk about web apps or let's talk about the web since before anyone called it web apps let's talk about websites let's talk about the different architectures and patterns that we have used to build stuff on the web go all the way back to the 1990s now when uh I wrote my first web page in 1992 I'm basically an internet dinosaur and back when the web first started it was pretty simple what it could do browsers could send a request to a server and say hey get me that file and web servers were basically file servers with a network connection they didn't do anything all they could do was you put files in a folder and when the browser says hey get me that the server gave the file back and the browser would render it and it would go hello welcome to our website in glorious Times New Roman and then it would go oh hang on this page has got an image on it it's got a gift and so it would send a request going hey can you get me images welcome GIF and the server would go oh yeah I got that one here and boom we get animated gifts and uh '90s web design had peaked at around this point now this pattern this is static HTML we didn't call it that because uh we didn't need to call it anything it was just web pages that that's all we had but static HTML it's uh it was a great way in the '90s of delivering content showing people stuff they wanted to read in 2024 it's still a great way of delivering content if you've got stuff that doesn't change very often maybe your restaurant has a menu that changes once a month you can upload a file once a month you can stick it in GitHub Pages you can put it on a Amazon S3 bucket and make that bucket public you can use a Content delivery Network thing about static HTML is it is incredibly cheap because you don't have to do any processing all your server is doing is going yeah here's the file and that is Trivial you can run a site that gets you know thousands millions of hits for a few dollars a month using static HTML hosting you can run it for free on something like GitHub pages won't cost you anything at all it's a great idea back in the '90s for certain kinds of problems it's still a great idea today now the next thing that happened HTTP 1.1 uh 1.0 then 1.1 came with the ability to fill out forms someone like these static pages are all well and good but what if what if we want our users to contact us or send us a message or buy something and so HTML forms were invented and most of the time when you finished filling out a form you'd hit submit and that would send a request to it s a post request to some kind of script like sendmail was a famous Pearl script that let you send emails from your web page and when that request came in send mail would go oh hang on all right uh let's wake up let's read the form let's generate send the email let's generate some HTML and it would send that email back to the client and the browser would go hey form sent thank you back to the homepage now this was the origin of server side rendering there's some code on the server which runs a program or runs a script and one of the outputs of that is a chunk of HTML that then gets rendered by the browser serers side rendering has really stood the test of time from CGI bin bash scripts through PHP uh classic ASP Ruby on Rails nodejs WordPress uh aspnet core if you use an MVC all of these Technologies are based on server side rendering it worked brilliantly back in the well maybe it didn't work quite so brilliantly with CGI but it has really stood the test of time it's a really powerful pattern the only downside is every time anyone hits one of your pages you need to run the code that generates the result and that can get expensive if you've got thousands of people tens of thousands hitting your site you're paying for all those Cycles you're paying for that computing power now in the '90s the future of web applications was going to be Java applets no one was going to build apps in JavaScript you were going to use Java and you were going to build little applets so someone could get a page from your and you'd send back some HTML which included an applet tag or an object tag and the browser out of the box would go you can't show that you need a plugin so you'd install the plugin and then hey then the plugin would go right I'm installed let me go to the server I'm going to get this Java class file here and boom there you go and suddenly you've got rich interactivity you've got games you've got you know interactive forms and applications now this pattern it wasn't just Java uh Shockwave Flash director Real Player QuickTime all of them used the browser plug-in ecosystem to do things that browsers couldn't do out of the box now that's kind of seemed like a great idea it had some security headaches then in 2007 Apple launched the iPhone and Apple went on record very early as saying no the iPhone is never going to run Java applets or Shockwave or Flash it's never going to run any plugins please build web applications instead using JavaScript and H HML we are not going to support plugins and that basically signed the death warrant for the whole plug-in Paradigm you know it kind of hung on for a couple of years but by 2015 if you had an app that needed Java applers you had a big problem finding browsers that knew how to run it now during the '90s JavaScript was invented in 1995 and it was originally just a glue language for sticking Java applets together the applets would do all the heavy lifting and you could do some fairly rudimentary stuff with it like someone could fill out your contact form and then when they got down to here and they clicked submit you could run a little snippet that would go hey confirm are you sure and pop up dialogues but it was really restricted one you had to include everything in the page script there was no way that clientside JavaScript could retrieve more data couldn't make requests couldn't talk to the rest of the world and two there was no way of sending anything back your client or your user is halfway through filling out a really complicated form with lots of JavaScript and everything on it if they press refresh it's all gone completely lost their work they got to start again now I remember what I was doing the day that this changed because this would have been 2002 maybe and Google launched a prototype a proof of concept for a Google search that had auto complete now I remember looking at this and calling over my friend at the next desk and be like hey check this out how did they do that because we were building web apps we were building websites for clients and they asked for this and we kept telling them it's impossible there's no way to do that and Google had figured out way to do it and actually the origin of this remarkably it comes from Outlook web access in about 2000 the team who were building Outlook web access this is the web client for Microsoft Outlook wanted a way of sending requests in the background so they went to the people who built Internet Explorer and said hey can we can we have a component that we can use to make like Network requests without having to reload the page and the Internet Explorer people said yeah and they plugged in a Thing Called xmlhttp request Outlook web access used this for a couple years but no one really kind of noticed because there weren't that many people using Outlook web access um support got added in Netscape a couple of other browsers so that they worked without Outlook and then Google went actually we can use this to do cool stuff now what's actually happening here is every time you press a key your browser is sending a request and getting fresh suggestions every time you press a key you've got this conversation backwards and forwards going on in the background and this unlocked a whole new way of building web appli appliations now this was initially uh the XML HTTP request wasn't terribly catchy round about 2005 someone said hey why don't we call it Ajax asynchronous JavaScript and XML or asynchronous Json and XML HTTP request um because a lot of the time they were using the XML HTTP request but the thing that's coming back from the server wasn't XML it would be Json or something else could be Snippets of HTML um this pattern worked brilliantly unlocked all kinds of cool authoring paradigms in about 2015 the browser vendors when we could probably come up with a nicer way of doing this and so they implemented an API called fetch fetch is still around today fetch works brilliantly you can do really cool stuff with it but this ability to send background requests meant we could start building new kinds of web applications instead of your web app being a collection of pages that lived on a server you could send a single page to the client with enough Behavior baked into it that when the client went hey show me a blue guitars you could send a request to your backend API something like a rest API and you go hey just get me the data for blue guitars and it would send back some data and you'd swap out that part of the page and you go red guitars and you send a request you'd get the data you'd plug that in you'd go oh what about black guitars and send a request and that would come back and boom there are the black guitars now single page apps work brilliantly most of the time it's a really really powerful Paradigm for Rich client side interactivity when they don't work so well the dead giveaway here is that one bit of the page will start spinning because there's a an element somewhere which is waiting for data to come back from the server and until it gets it can't draw anything so if you're ever on a web page where you click a button and little part of the page is replaced with a spinning icon you're looking at a single page application now single page apps proved incredibly popular react angular a lot of the JavaScript Frameworks that came out in the last sort of 15 years uh favored this pattern and they work brilliantly the next paradigm shift that came about all the technology we got so far it all has the same problem the browser has to start everything it doesn't matter if the server has the most exciting piece of news in the world can't do anything with it until it gets a request so the user has to click a button or click a link or some script on that client has to run and send a request to the server and it turns out there's certain kinds of apps you can't really build like that and so we invented websockets and the idea with a websocket is the browser connects to the server and it just leaves the connection open it's a new kind of connection it's lightweight it's long l and what this meant is we could build things like chat applications you type hello there that pops up a message here for me sends a request to the server hey Dylan said hello there but then that can send a notification now this is a big deal because for the first time we've got a way that the server can tell the browser hey something happened look boom you got a message and the person on the other end can go oh cool a message hello how's it going and that gets sent back we use the same mechanism on the other side and that pops up any anything you've ever used that has realtime collaboration at Google Docs Google Sheets Google Jam board if you use tools like Myro all these things web games multiplayer gaming over the web all of that is probably based on websockets now the last Paradigm the most recent one that's come about up till now everything here is running in JavaScript if you want the browser to do anything it has to be JavaScript and there were a bunch of tools Google web toolkit would let you write Java that would compile to JavaScript uh coffee script typescript are languages that transpile down to JavaScript because that's the only thing that the browser can understand then uh a few years ago a bunch of folks got together and went yeah we're not sure that this whole having to compile everything to JavaScript is a good idea um cuz when we run native applications directly on your laptop or your workstation uh you don't run them in JavaScript you run them in native code you have native executables and they said what if we built a a native runtime that existed inside a web browser web assembly now the premise here is you can write your app in whatever you want go Ruby rust C anything that compiles down to web assembly and that will you write your code pick the tool you want pick the language that works well for your problem or the language that your team enjoys using write your application compile it down to a wasm file publish it on your web server then at this point no JavaScript we're using whatever language we want we're not beholden to the language that the browser can understand understand then the client comes along they say hey get me wasm trust. HTML it sends back now there is still some JavaScript involved here because the only mechanism we've got right now for running web assembly is to use JavaScript to kind of bootstrap it but you don't need very much of it and what's that going to do the browser is going to fetch that Tetris doas file it's going to execute it and you've got rich native applications high performance Rich interactivity running right there in the browser kind of like Java applets we going to do in the '90s only we' kind of love learned a lot along the way now the really interesting thing to me about this uh this sort of whole set of timelines here is the only one that's genuinely dead is applets and plugins because that whole ecosystem just shut down doesn't work anymore but all of the rest they still solve certain kinds of problems as well as they ever did Static HTML if you want to put a restaurant menu on the internet and change it once a month static HTML was the best way of doing that in 1992 it's still the best way of doing that in 2024 if you want to render a product catalog and send back HTML which works with search engines works with screen readers works with accessibility server side rendering is your friend if you want to do minimal interactivity you just got Pages where you want some autocomplete or some Autos suggest XML HTTP request and uh fetch they work brilliantly for that single page apps yeah they're awesome they're everywhere well understood well documented lots of people know how to build them websocket you get to a point where you're doing real time notifications that's fantastic and if you get to the point where you want to build apps that you can deploy a native version and a web version you've got a team who want to do stuff in rust or go or C or you need performance you need really rich interactivity then web assembly giv us a whole new box of tools to play with so folks I hope you found that useful it's been a pleasure I'll catch you for the next one take it easy hey everybody how you doing Dylan here let's talk about web apps or let's talk about the web since before anyone called it web apps let's talk about websites let's talk about

# WebAssembly

The web is just the latest in a series in a series of oscillations that our industry has gone through since 1960s. These oscillations move back and forth between putting all the computer power in central servers and putting all the computing power out at the terminals.

We’ve seen several of these oscillations just in the last decade or so since the web became prominent. At first, we thought all the computer power would be in server farms, and the browsers would be stupid. Then we started putting applets in the browsers. But we didn’t like that, so we moved dynamic content back to the servers. But then we didn’t like that, so we invented Web 2.0 and moved lots of processing back into the browser with Ajax and JavaScript. We went so far as to create huge applications written to execute in the browsers. And now we’re all excited about pulling that JavaScript back into the server with Node…

And so the story goes. We can’t seem to figure out where we want the computing power. We go back and forth between cetralizing it and distributing it. And, I imagine, those oscillations will continue for some time to come.
