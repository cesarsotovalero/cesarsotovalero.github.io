  In this post, I argue that AI is not exactly creative as we are. Humans come up with unexpected ideas and behaviors, this is what makes life interesting. Humans have an special way to connect with each other, and AI can't replicate that.

I started to consume and appreciate coffee after I moved to Sweden.
Coffee is a key part of the Swedish culture of _fika_, and it's used as a tool to combat the dark winter ~~days~~ months.
For years, I've been considering the idea of buying a fancy coffee machine.
You know, like those that grind different beans to make various types of coffee brews.
My main motivation was to save time while having a wider range of coffee choices.
However, upon reflection, I ended up understanding that the experience of making coffee is as important to me as the coffee itself.
It turns out that I actually enjoy buying the coffee beans, grinding them by hand, putting the coffee powder in my [moka pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot), and taking the time to wait for the dark potion to be ready.
The whole experience is a time investment, yes, but I noticed that's also good for reducing the frequency of my coffee consumption.
So, modern coffee machines help to save time, but I still prefer making coffee myself.
The reason is that I enjoy the process, not just the result.
This situation made me think about the role of "the human experience" on many of the common things we do, and how AI is going to influence or change them in the future.
The rest of this article is my perspective on this matter, and where I believe current advances in AI are heading us.[^1]

    &#169; My manual coffee-making process is a time investment, but it also enhances the experience while simultaneously reducing the frequency of my coffee consumption. Will the efficiencies promised by AI come with the same joy?

Last week I participated at [Jfokus 2024](https://www.jfokus.se/talks/1661) as a speaker.
The main topic of the conference was the latest advances of AI and the impact of this technology on the software industry. 
I noticed a general acceptance of the huge potential of AI, and the many ways in which it could/would make everything more efficient for developers. 
For many of us, it looks like writing code, testing, deploying, documenting, or just creating any kind of digital content will be AI-assisted in the coming years.
So, there's a [notable concern](https://youtu.be/rENT1fDR69I?si=pH27Skp26xXGGp2D) regarding the future market need for human developers.
Honestly, I find the mere question freaking scary, not only because I'm a developer myself, but also because I believe that coding is a pretty advanced skill.

<aside class="quote">
    <em>“Coding is one of the latest skills nurtured by our modern civilization.”</em>
</aside>

Beyond coding, today's AI is menacing to automatize every aspect of our lives.
One of AI's major promises is freeing us from seemingly mundane tasks.
However, I'm worried that too much automation could relegate "the human touch" of our daily activities to a second place.
Activities and chores like making coffee, serving wine, cooking, painting, writing, playing music, making love, or chatting with friends could lose their essence.
Coding at its core is a human activity in which people contribute following conventions (and Git rules).

After a though or two, I realize that in most aspects of my life, I'm not looking for perfection, I'm rather seeking for the experience.
For example, I had a [great time](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cesarsotovalero_jfokus2024-javacommunity-success-activity-7161289069065338880-ptRZ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) at Jfokus this year, I met a lot of people, and I had a good share of fun because of that. 
I could have saved some time and money by watching the talks on YouTube later.
However, I believe that there is much less value in doing that because the act of being there, physically, is a big part of the experience.
Nevertheless, I'm afraid that a future fueled by AI solutions could irremediably change this perception.

# Promises

AI promises to propel our species to the next level, whatever that may be.
At the individual level, it involves freeing us from mundane tasks so that we'll have more free time to do what we want.
Imagine the kinds of optimizations that an [Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) system could offer us! 
It could, for example, give us exactly what we want without rambling, because it will "know" us better than we know ourselves (I'm not talking about Google here). 
No pain in searching for the right food, the right music, the right movie, the right book, the right partner... you get the idea. 
Our AI companion will provide the exact match for our needs, always.

However, I'm afraid that technological advances of a similar scale have already happened before.
And every time, we thought we were going to have more free time as well.
Yet, we're still working 40 hours a week (just about the same as our gatherer ancestors did 1 million years ago). 
As humans, we saw the rise of agriculture 10 000 years ago, freeing us from the need to hunt and gather.
We saw the rise of the industrial revolution 2 000 years ago, freeing us from the need to produce everything by hand.
We saw the rise of the internet in the last 30 years, freeing us from the need to go to the physical library to find information. 
Do we have more free time now?
Not really.
Human freedom didn't happen back then and probably won't happen now with AI.

I would like to be positive and believe that a 4-hour workweek is closer than ever.
I want to believe in the potential of an AI that understands my strengths and weaknesses and helps me to be more efficient. 
But I'm not sure if that's going to happen. 
Or even if being more efficient would make me happier.
Instead, I think that AI is going to reshape the way we interact with the world, meaning that some new behaviors will be added and others will be removed. 
There is one in particular thing that I'm concerned about: the human experience.

# Supremacy

AI systems have the potential to become ubiquitous. 
In contrast with other breakthroughs for which infrastructure had to be built from scratch such as transportation and telephony, AI solutions integrate well with our already deployed digital environment, e.g., mobile phones and IoT devices.
This means that in the case of AI, the potential for adoption is wider than with any other technology.
AI scalability is taken for granted.

<aside class="quote">
    <em>“AI poses a solution to many problems, but we're merely starting to discover what we can solve with it.”</em>
</aside>

AI models like LLMs have absorbed all the open knowledge of humanity and learned from it.
Contrary to previous machine learning models, they started to generate new knowledge from our existing corpus.
The power of these new models is just mind-blowing.
They are already being used to solve problems that were previously thought to be very difficult.

Here are just three examples of applied AI that already impress me:

- **[FIGURE 01 Humanoid Robot](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2024/01/figure-01-humanoid-bot-has-learned-to-make-coffee.html)** that can learn how to make coffee.
- **[AMIE](https://blog.research.google/2024/01/amie-research-ai-system-for-diagnostic_12.html)**, an AI system that outperforms human doctors in every field (including empathy).
- **[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)**, the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool.

Now consider a world in which everything is decided and handled by a super powerful AI system. 
Our daily activities would be much more efficient. 
Would it be interesting to live in such a world from a human perspective?
I'm not sure though.

We have seen machine learning systems taking over our decision-making process before.
For example, let's take a look at the [Netflix recommendation system](https://research.netflix.com/research-area/recommendations). 
It enhances customer engagement, which is great from a business perspective, but I don't feel that it's particularly good for viewers at large.
Not to mention our current struggling with social media and the [filter bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble).
AI is as powerful as dangerous.

We already have [VTubers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTuber), and many forms of AI-generated "art" like music, books, movies, and games. 
However, AI content somehow feels different to me compared to traditional human creativity.
Indeed, I personally experience some kind of aversion to AI-generated content.
For some reason, when I notice that it's AI-generated, I immediately lose interest.

I wish it could be like a personal choice.
Do we even have the right to decide how much do we want to get involved with AI?
The answer is no.
Just like the internet, AI is going to be everywhere.

# Acceptance

Let's fully embrace the will of AI for a moment. 
Let's say it comes up with a decision, and we have no other option other than accepting it.
How comfortable are we going to be with the fact that we're not in control anymore?
Not much, right?
I'm not very enthusiastic about the idea. 

For example, what about having an AI selecting the right candidate for a job?
It would be better at it than most humans for 80% of the cases.
But for the remainder 20%, how does it know what kind of person we need?
What about an AI deciding who goes to jail and who doesn't?
It will be make the right decision for 99.9999% of the cases.
What about the case when it is wrong?
I don't know, but it's coming.

On the other hand, the things that we thought were inherently human, like art and creativity, are now easily replicable using AI.
If in doubt, just look at the stuff created by [Midjourney.](https://www.midjourney.com/home).
Very soon there will be AI creating 3D objects, full movies, and even entire virtual worlds.
Take it or leave it, art will never be the same. 

# The Human Experience

<aside class="quote">
    <em>“[Some of] the best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads. That sucks.”</em>
    ― <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Hammerbacher">Jeff Hammerbacher</a></cite>
</aside>

My generation of Millennials already chosen to make of [internet the new electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Internet_access).
Now AI seems to be the brand-new internet.
For example, today, you can buy any clothes without ever meeting the seller in person.
With AI, you will be able to bring the seller back virtually.
It looks like AI is just taking it further.

If you go to a bar, you will soon encounter AI bartenders serving the right wine and telling you exactly what you want to hear.
But as humans, we still crave for discrepancies, those unexpected events that occur from time to time.
Strangely, that's what will end up remembering after all!
How much of the human experience are we sacrificing for those AI's efficiencies?
To what extent will these efficiencies become widely accepted?

<aside class="quote">
    <em>“I'm biased towards human interaction, AI will never replace the true human experience.”</em>
</aside>

Something we learned from Covid is that we need human interaction.
People enjoy being with others.
They watch videos on YouTube but still prefer attending live events.

As humans, we feel a sense of pride in whatever we do well.
Is by overcoming the struggles where we find our sense of fulfillment.
In a future where the experience of overcoming troubles is minimized, what will be the source of our pride?

# The Social Killer

It's always the case that we try to envision new technology in terms of practical use cases for good.
But history has shown that technology, although intended for good, often ends up being used for nefarious purposes.
The reality, measured against history, is unlikely to be good.
The question is: how do we minimize that?

<aside class="quote">
    <em>“AI-powered systems menace to become new social killer.”</em>
</aside>

We are losing many social capabilities because of technology.
Cell phones used to be the best in town to eliminate human interaction.
AI will be better at it.
It will be interesting to see how AI takes this to the next level.

Why is social media so bad?
Perhaps those at the top want us to become addicted to it so they can maintain their positions.
Corporations are driven by financial gain, seeking any avenue that minimizes costs and maximizes revenue.
Humans are seen as a cost, whether in food production, software development, or car sales.
Companies are already exploring how to eliminate human elements to optimize revenue, as that's where they see the value.
As a customer, I highly value the social interaction in many life endeavors.

Non-verbal interaction is incredibly important.
You meet a person and learn from the entire experience of being human.
Children learn from their parents, but now they are learning from the internet.
Thus, they start imitating what they see online, which is not beneficial.
In a few years, we are going to see children speaking like an AI.

# Sparks of Hope

<aside class="quote">
    <em>“For the most part of everything I do, I'm not looking for perfection, I'm rather seeking for the experience.”</em> 
</aside>

I would like to end this seemingly pessimistic article with a positive section.
AI has all the potential to augment the human experience to a level that we have never seen before.
Perhaps, if AI frees up more of our time, we'll have more opportunities to do things together.
I would rather go hiking or fishing in the mountains with my children in that case.

    &#169; According to <a href="https://www.amacad.org/sites/default/files/publication/downloads/Daedalus_Sp22_19_Brynjolfsson.pdf">Erik Brynjolfsson</a>, opportunities for augmenting humans are far greater than opportunities to automate existing tasks.

It seems that we are not going to lose our jobs as long as we learn how to use and leverage AI.
There will be a new set of jobs as happened before.
One example is the case of education.

Today we have human teachers dealing with 10 or more children at the same time.
An AI that can bring personalized education experience to every child in the world.
AI teachers could be really revolutionary.
We can make a private teacher that is specifically trained to suit every children needs.
In this way, high-quality education will become accessible to everyone.

AI can design beautiful and valid architecture structures, way better than our ugly square buildings.
So, beautiful architecture is going to become possible for way more people that what it is now.
But, my big hope on AI is to used in politics.
To improve democracy by listening and taking into account everyone's voice, to have a true data-driven politic system.   
For example, an AI can analyze the individual needs of every citizen and make the best decision, from the neighborhood, to country as a whole, and beyond.

We risks to have less human interaction, but maybe we'll have more time.
It's all about choices in our society.
AI is already here, it's not going anywhere, and it's inevitable.

For example, the case of VR headsets, like the recently launched Apple Vision Pro.
