Recently, a few friends have asked me to give them feedback on their résumés. 
They are all Computer Science PhD graduates looking to land a new job in the tech industry. 
You might think these people are the cream of the crop, so those résumés should look awesome, right? 
Well, not really. 
I remember my first résumé was awful (I don't even have the guts to share it here).
I had no experience writing résumés, and it took me a while to understand what a great one looks like.
Now I know that building an awesome résumé takes time, effort, and conscious planning. 
If you ask me the question: 
_What makes a résumé stand out from the crowd?_ 
I think of three things: **simplicity**, **solidity**, and **uniqueness**. 
This post revolves about what I mean by these three words.
Alright, I know there is already a ton of content out there about how to properly craft a résumé. 
However, I still want to share **my personal take on this matter**.
Because this topic is subjective, so everyone has a different perspective, and I just like to share mine.
To narrow it down, my views and opinions in this post are specifically for PhD students and Computer Science professionals. 
So in this post, I'll cover how I would envision and structure the résumé of a scientist.
This includes what content to include, and what I believe are common mistakes to avoid.
Hopefully, if you're working on yours, these tips will help you create a résumé that's strong, powerful, memorable, and catchy; and then receive a $200K+ offer (just kidding).
But seriously, a good résumé can make a huge difference in your job search and career development.
And it's not so hard to get it right when having the right scores!

# Purpose

{% badge /img/posts/2024/2024-01-12/leveled-up.png 140 https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1awyypu/my_diablo_1_level_50_warrior_after_12_years/ %}

[//]: # (TODO - focus on computer scientists and write it as if it was a videogame )
Indeed, I'm working on improving my résumé every single day!
Meaning that it's important to be intentional with what we plan to achieve professionally, and then on how we want to present ourselves to the world.
A good résumé also requires some understanding (and vision) of the job market and the current and future needs of potential employers.

Ok, so let's start by the ~~obvious~~ fact that a [résumé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9) is a document, meaning it's a set of words put on a page.
Notably, this traditional old-fashioned format has been around for centuries.[^2]
Its primary purpose has always been to present an individual's skills, experience, and qualifications to potential employers.
It serves as a marketing tool that allows job-seekers to showcase their suitability for a certain job.
Résumés aim to make a positive first impression, highlight relevant accomplishments, and secure an interview with the stakeholder.
So it will not get you the job, but almost.

The concept of résumés has evolved over time, reflecting changes in the job market and the expectations of employers.
With the industrial revolution, there was a greater need for workers to present their skills and experience in a more formalized manner.
People changed jobs more frequently, and the qualifications required for different roles became more specialized.
Hence, résumés began to include more structured information about an individual’s work history and education.
The rise of office jobs and corporate culture in the mid-20th century further solidified the importance of résumés.
Employers began to expect well-organized résumés that clearly outlined an applicant's qualifications and experience.

Over time, résumés have also become tools for personal branding.
They not only list qualifications but also reflect an individual’s professional identity, career goals, and unique value proposition.
In today's competitive job market, a well-crafted résumé can make all the difference in securing a job interview.
Or at least, that's the idea.

# Sniping

{% badge /img/posts/2024/2024-01-12/target.png 140 https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/american_english/sniper %}

Companies hire people because they can immediately bring something to the table and make an impact on a future project.
What you did as a research assistant back in 2011 is completely meaningless, especially since your recent research experience is much more impressive.
Therefore, in the highly competitive tech industry, I suggest adopting the mindset of a sniper when crafting your résumé. 
The essence of this approach is to focus on precision and relevance.
Companies are looking to hire candidates who can immediately contribute and make an impact on future projects.
Therefore, it is crucial to highlight your most recent and significant accomplishments, rather than dwelling on outdated experiences.
For example, detailing your current research projects and their outcomes will be far more compelling than mentioning a research assistant position from a decade ago.

The good jobs are never publicly advertised; they are internal. 
However, you need to start somehow and get inside before seeing them.
Furthermore, it's important to recognize that the most coveted jobs are often not publicly advertised. 
These positions are typically filled internally or through referrals. 
To gain access to these hidden opportunities, you need to first secure a position within the company.
Networking and recommendations are super important.
In academia, recommendations are paramount; many PhD graduates, including myself, have secured positions through direct referrals.
Most people I know got my PhD through a direct recommendation (including myself).
Therefore, building a strong network and seeking recommendations can be as important as having a well-crafted résumé.

We need to understand the process depending on the size of the company (ADD A DIAGRAM including HR, HIRING MANAGER, JOB POSTING ADD, INTERNAL AD, etc.)
Understanding the hiring process is also essential, as it varies with the size of the company.
For instance, larger companies may involve multiple stages, including HR screenings, interviews with hiring managers, and internal job postings. 
Smaller companies might have a more streamlined process.
Visualizing this process can be helpful, so consider including a diagram in your preparation materials that outlines the steps from job posting to final hiring.

[//]: # (TODO Diagram goes here)

A good CV is not a guarantee of anything; ultimately, it just gives you more opportunities to get more interviews.
A strong résumé is just the first step; it opens the door to interviews, where you can further demonstrate your fit for the role and ultimately secure the position.

# Structure

{% badge /img/posts/2024/2024-01-12/map.png 140 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award %}

When crafting your résumé, it's essential to give it a clear and logical structure. 
Start with your name and contact information, followed by links to your professional profiles, such as LinkedIn or a personal website showcasing your projects and publications. 

Here's what I think it must have:
- Full name
- Email
- Key achievement
- Current role
- Education
- Projects
- Hobbies

Next, highlight your unique skills, especially those that align with the job you are applying for. 
This could include specific programming languages, frameworks, or methodologies that are particularly relevant to the position. 
Following this, detail your education, emphasizing degrees, certifications, and any honors or awards received. 
Ensure each section is clearly labeled and easy to navigate, creating a document that is both visually appealing and easy to read.

Consider creating two versions of your résumé: one tailored for the hiring manager and another for the HR department. 
The version for the hiring manager should emphasize your technical skills and accomplishments, showcasing the depth of your expertise and the impact of your work. 
Meanwhile, the HR version could be the boring version and  include more general keywords and phrases that align with the job description, ensuring it passes through applicant tracking systems (ATS) and resonates with non-technical reviewers. 
This strategic approach increases the likelihood that your résumé will be noticed by both technical and non-technical personnel involved in the hiring process.

A résumé should also reflect your passion and career aspirations. 
Beyond listing your technical skills and work experience, include elements that demonstrate your commitment to the field.
or example, for me, showing that you have taught someone in some course (even children) means that you are driven not only for money but that you really have a love for the profession. It means that you’re giving something back to the community.
This can highlight your enthusiasm for the profession and your willingness to contribute beyond the immediate demands of a job, making you a more attractive candidate to potential employers.

# Content

{% badge /img/posts/2024/2024-01-12/parchment.png 140 # %}

Think of your résumé as a direct commercial proposal.
You are the product being marketed. 
The objective is to showcase something that is extremely unique to you, something that makes you stand out. 
Something that no one else has and is relevant for the role you're applying to.
Highlight your distinct achievements and skills that set you apart from other candidates. 
Whether it's a particular project, a groundbreaking research paper, or a specialized skill, make sure to feature something that is exclusively yours and reflects your unique professional identity.
This distinctive element is what will grab the attention of potential employers and make your résumé memorable.

Positioning yourself as a specialist rather than a generalist is key.
I think you should position yourself as if you are super specialized.
A broad title like "software engineer" can be too vague and may undervalue your expertise. 
Instead, narrow down your focus to something more specific, such as "database query specialist" or "machine learning algorithm expert." 
This specialization not only makes you appear more skilled but also positions you as a premium candidate in your niche. 
The more precise your skills and experiences are, the more likely you are to stand out in a crowded job market and be perceived as a valuable asset.

It’s super important to me if the person has his own projects; it means he did something himself.
Personal projects demonstrate initiative, creativity, and a passion for your field. 
They show that you are not just working for a paycheck but are genuinely interested in advancing your skills and contributing to the industry. 
Be sure to include links to these projects, whether they are GitHub repositories, live applications, or detailed case studies. 
Providing tangible evidence of your work supports the claims you make in your résumé and allows potential employers to see your skills in action.
The text you write should be supported by facts, I love links.
This factual support builds credibility and strengthens your overall proposal.

## Skills

{% badge /img/posts/2024/2024-01-12/medal.png 140 # %}

When it comes to listing skills on your résumé, I often see candidates including basics like Git,[^1] CI/CD, Docker, REST APIs, Python, unit tests, backend, frontend, etc. 
Frankly, this approach misses the mark.
_What does it mean frontend?_
These are basic instruments that all developers should have, akin to listing "laptop," "Firefox," "Internet," or "coffee" as essential items for an office job.
Instead, focus on specific frameworks and technologies that demonstrate your depth of knowledge and expertise. 
For instance, mention frameworks like Django or Flask for Python, React or Angular for frontend development, or Kubernetes for container orchestration. T
These specifics paint a clearer picture of your capabilities and the environments you excel in.

When it comes to languages, only list those you are truly proficient in, especially if you can claim polyglot status with more than three languages.
English doesn't count because you are (as a professional in tech industry) by default expected to be proficient.
English is a basic skill, the language of international communication, just like GitHub is the place to share code.
By listing only the languages you know well, you avoid diluting your résumé with unnecessary information and instead present a concise and focused skill set.

Another crucial aspect is to avoid overloading your résumé with the minutiae of every software application you've developed. 
Employers are more interested in the impact and scale of your work than the granular details. 
Highlight your accomplishments with clear, quantifiable metrics. For example, for a programmer, you might include statements like, "I’ve written 15K lines of code (LoC) in the last two years" or "I’ve merged 20 pull requests in this large project on GitHub." 
These numbers provide tangible evidence of your contributions and productivity, offering a snapshot of your capabilities and work ethic.

## Qualities

{% badge /img/posts/2024/2024-01-12/brain.png 140 # %}

When it comes to highlighting your personal qualities on a résumé, it's important to strike the right tone.
Don’t praise yourself excessively or come across as pretentious. 
It's far more effective to speak about yourself with modesty and let your achievements and experiences speak for themselves. 
Only if needed, include testimonials or references from colleagues and mentors who can vouch for your skills and character. 
This third-party validation often carries more weight than self-praise and provides a more credible and balanced view of your professional persona.

I think it's actually good when someone talks about his weaknesses and criticizes himself.
I have great respect for individuals who acknowledge their weaknesses and demonstrate a willingness to learn and grow. 
For instance, sharing a story about how you submitted a paper that was rejected multiple times because of low quality.
Something like: "_I submitted a paper, and it was rejected two times, I didn't give up and improved it along the way, so it got accepted on the third attempt_." 
I would respect that kind of assertion. 
This kind of honest self-assessment not only highlights your perseverance but also shows that you are open to feedback and dedicated to professional growth. Such transparency can be very appealing to potential employers.

I believe that including a professional picture is important, despite some regional regulations against it to avoid discrimination.[^3]
Hiring managers need to see who they will work with.
A clear, professional photo helps hiring managers visualize who they might be working with and can make your application more memorable.
Alongside your picture, provide links to verify your accomplishments. 
Whether it’s a link to a published paper, a successful project, or a professional profile, these links serve as concrete evidence of your achievements. 
However, I would advise against listing MOOC courses (you’re just decreasing your value or discrediting yourself). 
While they are excellent for personal growth, mentioning them on your résumé might detract from your formal education and professional experience.
I only keep [my own list of online MOOCs](../courses.html) for myself to not forget.
Focus your résumé on more substantial credentials and accomplishments.

## Passions

{% badge /img/posts/2024/2024-01-12/hearth.png 140 # %}

When reviewing a résumé, I always look for indications of what you are passionate about. 
If you are a programmer, having a GitHub account with a few projects is a fantastic way to showcase your dedication to coding. 
It tells me that you are not just doing it for a paycheck but genuinely enjoy creating and sharing your work with the community. 
These projects can serve as tangible proof of your skills and enthusiasm, giving me a deeper insight into what drives you professionally.

However, I also appreciate seeing that you have interests outside of programming.
It’s important to demonstrate that you are a well-rounded individual with diverse passions. 
For instance, if you enjoy playing the guitar or cooking, mention these hobbies. 
It shows that you have a life beyond the screen and that you bring a variety of experiences and perspectives to your work.
Being passionate about different things can make you more creative and resilient, traits that are highly valuable in any profession.

Consistency in your passions is another crucial factor. 
I want to see that your interest in programming, or any other field, is not just a passing phase. 
If you've been consistently programming for many years, it shows commitment and a deep-seated interest in your craft. 
This consistency indicates that you are likely to be dedicated and reliable in your professional endeavors as well. 
It’s not just about what you do; it’s about how long and how passionately you’ve been doing it.
Demonstrating this long-term commitment to your passions makes you a more compelling candidate and paints a fuller picture of who you are.

# Common Mistakes

{% badge /img/posts/2024/2024-01-12/red-flag.png 140 # %}

In my years of reviewing résumés, I've seen a fair share of common mistakes that candidates make, which can significantly impact their chances of landing a job. 
One of the first things I advise against is using HeadHunter or any other automatic résumé builder websites. 
Each résumé should be unique and tailored to the specific job you’re applying for. 
A public templated résumé often lacks personality and lowers the reviewer's impression. 
Although a unique résumé may force the recruiter to do some mental work to understand it, the key is to make it as short and clear as possible, ideally one page. 
This approach ensures that your résumé stands out without overwhelming the reader.

You're probably not going to like this, but cutting your résumé down to one page is crucial. 
I understand the challenge, especially for those with extensive academic and teaching backgrounds. 
However, it's essential to be concise. You can summarize the entire last page of publications with a single bullet point: "Numerous academic publications, talks, and conference presentations. Complete list available at my LinkedIn." 
The same goes for teaching experience; consolidate it into one bullet point. No one reads more than one page, so make sure every word counts.

Another common mistake is listing online certificates. 
While they are valuable for personal development, they don’t carry much weight in the professional world compared to your PhD. 
Simply listing your PhD under education is often sufficient. Including non-tech experiences, like plumbing, is also a misstep. 
It distracts from your relevant skills and can give the impression that you’re not focused on your tech career. 
Similarly, mentioning freelancing can sometimes work against you. 
It might suggest that you’re not accustomed to the demands of a full-time job, which could be a red flag for some employers.

When it comes to your educational background, only mention the university you graduated from if it’s well-known with a solid reputation. 
Otherwise, it’s better to focus on your qualifications and achievements. 
Additionally, frequent job changes can be a major red flag. 
Employers typically look for a minimum of three years at each company. 
This stability indicates that you’ve had enough time to learn and contribute significantly. 
Changing jobs too frequently can make you appear unstable and unreliable.

It’s also important to be honest about your experience level. 
Don’t claim to be a senior researcher if you don’t have the papers to back it up. 
Exaggerating your experience can worsen the impression you make. 
For example, if you only have one year of experience, it’s unrealistic to claim expertise in more than three technologies.
If you list Machine Learning in Python, TensorFlow, and other advanced skills, be prepared to substantiate your knowledge with contributions to projects like TensorFlow on GitHub.


# Conclusion

The résumé has evolved from a simple letter of skills and experience to a complex and dynamic document that plays a crucial role in the job application process. Its primary purpose remains the same: to connect job seekers with potential employers by effectively communicating their qualifications and suitability for the job.
In conclusion, writing a résumé is about balancing brevity with detail, honesty with ambition, and uniqueness with clarity. Avoid these common mistakes, and you’ll be on your way to crafting a résumé that truly stands out and resonates with potential employers.
