Last week I met a PhD former student colleague. 
She is in the last year of her PhD.
I asked the usual: _How are you doing?_
She replied with a wistful smile: _I'm working on last paper._
Her face showed a mix of fatigue and resignation.
It's clear that she was under pressure to finish "one last paper more."
I understand the situation because I've been there too.
I've seen it many times.
The "last paper myth" is a common experience among PhD students.
It is not just pervasive in academia but is a reflection of broader conflicting interests.
In this blog post, I aim to unpack the "last paper myth" for academics and discuss implications beyond academic circles.
My intention is to decompose this situation and provide actionable insights on how to identify, address, and navigate the last minute pressures both in academia and in future professional engagements.
Let's start by looking at the expectation v.s reality in the last year of a PhD student.

# Expectation

- Being at the last year and expecting to write your thesis means that you are already succeeded in your PhD studies. You have already published several papers, struggled and learned a lot. So your supervisor knows that, and you're his most valuable resource. So, he will ask you to write the last paper. This is the last paper myth.
- You will surely finish your PhD with some papers submitted, this means that you will have to later receive the feedback from the reviewers, address their comments, and resubmit the paper. This is a long process that can take several months. It's work that you will have to do after you finish your PhD whether or not you decide to stay in academia. Of course, you can reject doing it, but just think about all the work that your have put into the paper, and the fact that it's in your best interest to have it published. So, you will have to do it.
- The PhD is actually a confrontation of interests between the supervisor and the student. The supervisor wants to have "the papers that he or she wants published," and the student wants to finish the PhD. The student will have to do the work, and the supervisor will have to push the student to do it. This is how it works. So in order for the supervisor to accomplish his or her goals, he or she will have to go through a long process of teaching the student how to conduct research and write research paper. This is a long journey and sometimes it just doesn't work out for the supervisor, so successful students who has proven themselves are very valuable resources for supervisors.
- Many PhD candidates find themselves in a perpetual state of preparing just one more paper, urged on by their supervisors even as they near what they believe to be the end of their academic requirements. This blog post delves into the dynamics of this issue, exploring the complexities of academic labor, expectations, and the often conflicting interests between PhD candidates and their supervisors.
- By exploring these facets, this blog post aims to contribute to a better understanding of the real dynamics of completing a PhD and to foster a dialogue that could lead to meaningful changes in how academia operates, particularly in its treatment of its most vulnerable members—its students.


Historically, the PhD was conceived as a journey of intellectual growth and discovery, culminating in a significant contribution to a field of knowledge. 
Over decades, this has evolved under increasing pressures for funding, publication metrics, and academic prestige, influencing supervisor expectations and student experiences.

1. **Expectation vs. Reality**: PhD candidates enter their final year with the belief that their remaining task is to consolidate their years of research into their final thesis. Contrarily, supervisors, recognizing the productivity and increasing capability of their seasoned students, may push for more output in the form of additional papers.

2. **Academic and Emotional Toll**: The pressure to produce "one last paper" can extend the duration of PhD programs, adding to the financial and emotional strain on students. This scenario raises questions about the balance of power in academic relationships and the mental health of PhD students.

3. **Career Implications**: While additional papers can enhance a student's academic portfolio, they also require time for revisions and responses to peer review, which can extend beyond the PhD tenure. This necessitates commitments that might clash with new career responsibilities if students move out of academia.

4. **Ethical Considerations**: The supervisor’s insistence on additional papers can reflect a conflict of interest, where the student’s need to complete their program and possibly move on to professional engagements is at odds with the supervisor’s desire for continued academic output and prestige.

- **The Myth of the Last Paper**: The notion that one final paper will conclusively end the PhD cycle is often a myth, perpetuated by the ongoing academic contributions that benefit the supervisor’s scholarly profile potentially at the expense of the student's well-being and career timeline.

- **Student Autonomy vs. Supervisor Control**: This theme explores the degree of control PhD students have over their research agendas versus the influence exerted by their supervisors. It raises questions about academic freedom and student rights in research settings.

- **Quality vs. Quantity of Research**: Debates arise over whether pushing students for more papers genuinely enhances the scientific community or simply saturates the field with rushed, less-thorough research in pursuit of academic quantity over quality.

A review of recent academic studies and industry reports highlights a growing recognition of these issues within higher education discourse. Studies in journals such as *Higher Education Research & Development* and reports from the *Chronicle of Higher Education* provide evidence of both the prevalence and impact of this push for "the last paper." These sources reveal that while some students benefit from the extra push, often in terms of increased publications, others feel exploited and overextended.

# Reality

# Takeaways

# Conclusions

The continual push for "the last paper" raises significant concerns about how academia values and uses the labor of PhD students. It highlights the need for clearer policies on the expectations and rights of doctoral candidates, suggesting a shift towards more supportive, transparent, and ethically grounded supervisory practices.

As academia moves forward, it is crucial to reassess the balance between producing quality research and maintaining humane, fair, and supportive environments for PhD candidates. Only through such reevaluations can the academic community hope to sustain its integrity and the trust of its scholars.

This investigation opens up several avenues for further research, including the development of interventions that institutions can implement to ensure fair practices in PhD supervision. Additionally, it calls for a broader discussion within the academic community about the nature of doctoral studies and the role of publication pressures in shaping the experiences and outcomes of PhD students.
