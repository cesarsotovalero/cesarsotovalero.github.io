I recently went to a serious Hackathon. 

This post is not about hackathons, though.

The task was TODO, with the following CONSTRAINS.

Everyone, absolutely every team made a scheduling app (it is clearly an easy thing to do).
- to find availability times
- chatbots to make employees happy

# What AI is good and not good for

# What I want to see built

# Footnotes

The takeaways is simple: I'll not do another boring AI powered scheduling app.
