The AI fever has been around for a while now (4 years as I can count).
It reminds me the [gold rush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_rush) in the 19th century. 
Today any single individual might become abundantly wealthy almost instantly by leveraging AI's capabilities the right way.
The potential opportunities to apply AI for profit span almost all forms of art and engineering, also medical diagnosis, and even to [generate new scientific hypotheses](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352847823001557).
Yet, as history seems to repeat itself, every time OpenAI or MidJourney make new leaps offering more powerful capabilities, many startups flounder and fade.
It happened during the gold rush, when many prospectors went bankrupt while a few struck gold.
I've attended many hackathons where teams have tried to build AI-powered solutions for problems that could be solved with a simple rule-based system.
So, if you're a developer or entrepreneur itching to dive into the generative AI space for fun or profit, this post is a step back to reflect on what (I believe) _shouldn't_ be built with AI. 
Let's dive in!

# What Seems to Work

I'm not an entrepreneur myself (yet), but I'm overall an enthusiast of the startup ecosystem.
I listen to [Indie Hackers Podcasts](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcasts), read [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/), and check cool launches on [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com) from time to time.
Over the years, I've seen many startups succeed and fail along the way.
Whenever there is a new technology, there is a wave of startups trying to profit from it (e.g., remembered blockchain 10 years ago?).

I'm convinced that Generative AI (GenAI) is a powerful tech that can [transform whole industries](https://www.cesarsotovalero.net/blog/surviving-the-ai-revolution-as-a-software-engineer.html) and create new opportunities.
I think GenAI will first optimize existing processes and then create new ones.
Everything related to handling paperwork and repetitive tasks will be eventually automated.
That's actually good because these boring tasks were not meant for humans in the first place anyway.
Second, GenAI will create new opportunities for everyone, including artists and creators, to express themselves in ways that were not possible before.
For example, AI-powered content creation tools such as [Adobe Firefly](https://www.adobe.com/products/firefly.html) are already transforming the creative industry.



1. **Personalized Financial Advisors**
  - Apps that analyze spending habits, investment opportunities, and financial health using AI are gold. These tools cater to the rising demand for financial literacy and can scale personalized advice to millions.
  - Example: Wealthfront’s AI-driven financial planning features are transforming personal finance management.
  - Why it works: High demand and tangible ROI for users.

2. **Content Creation Tools**
  - Generative AI is a boon for creators. Platforms that assist with scriptwriting, graphic design, or even video editing are gaining traction.
  - Example: Adobe’s Firefly enhances creativity by automating repetitive tasks.
  - Why it works: It saves time, amplifies human creativity, and has clear market demand.

3. **AI in Healthcare**
  - Tools like AI-powered symptom checkers or personalized fitness coaches empower users to manage their health better.
  - Example: MyFitnessPal leverages AI for smarter diet recommendations.
  - Why it works: There’s a growing emphasis on preventive health solutions that are scalable and cost-effective.

# What to Avoid

Numerous AI-driven photo apps fail due to over-saturation and lack of resources to compete against the tech giants that already have customer trust and a large user base.

1. **Overhyped General-Purpose Chatbots**
  - Why they fail: Chatbots are ubiquitous, and most fail to differentiate themselves. Unless your bot is solving a specific problem better than existing solutions, it’s just another chatbot.
  - Example: Microsoft’s Tay chatbot famously spiraled out of control due to poor moderation and biased training data ([Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/01/top-5-failures-of-ai-till-date-reasons-solution/)).

2. **AI for the Sake of AI**
  - Why they fail: Building something just because “AI is hot” often leads to feature bloat and unclear user value. Many startups end up with flashy demos but no sustainable business model.
  - Example: Numerous AI photo filter apps hit the market and quickly faded due to oversaturation.

3. **Poorly Thought-Out Healthcare Applications**
  - Why they fail: While healthcare is promising, it’s also highly regulated. Products that don’t comply with data protection laws or fail to address ethical concerns will face backlash.
  - Example: Forward Health’s CarePods failed due to technical glitches and poor location choices ([Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/healthcare-startup-forward-shutdown-carepod-adrian-aoun-2024-11)).

4. **Tools Targeting Hyper-Niche Markets**
  - Why they fail: Niche markets often lack the scale needed to make an app profitable. AI tools for ultra-specific tasks, like “AI for knitting pattern generation,” may not justify the investment.
  - Example: Tally’s credit management platform collapsed due to limited scalability and poor product pivots ([Selldone](https://selldone.com/blog/major-startup-failures-2024-824)).

# Key Lessons from AI Failures

1. Bias Is Your Biggest Enemy**
AI systems that perpetuate bias can quickly tarnish a company’s reputation. Microsoft’s Tay chatbot is a textbook case of how biased data leads to PR disasters.

2. Privacy Is Non-Negotiable**
Apps that mishandle sensitive data, especially in healthcare and finance, risk regulatory penalties and losing user trust. Always prioritize data protection.

3. Don’t Overpromise**
Many startups crumble because they promise the moon but deliver a rock. Be transparent about your AI’s capabilities and limitations.

# What Makes an AI Idea Worth Pursuing?

1. **Clear Value Proposition**
  - Ask yourself: Does this app solve a real problem? And does it do so in a way that’s better than existing solutions?

2. **Scalability**
  - Avoid hyper-niche markets unless you have a compelling reason to believe they’ll grow.

3. **Ethical Design**
  - Consider potential misuse of your AI. Tools like deepfake generators have immense creative potential but can also be used maliciously.

# Final Thoughts

The generative AI gold rush is far from over, but striking gold requires careful planning. Focus on building apps that solve real problems, respect user privacy, and offer tangible benefits. Avoid chasing trends for the sake of it, and learn from the mistakes of others.

Remember: AI is not a magic wand; it’s a tool. Use it wisely.
