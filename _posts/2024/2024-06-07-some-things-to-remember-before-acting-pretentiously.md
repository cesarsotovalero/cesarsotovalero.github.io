A few days ago, I was asked: _"Where do you see yourself in 10 or 20 years?"_
I replied:
_"I would like to get some sort of recognition for my contributions... maybe to be known as an expert in something, someone who is consulted and listened to before important decisions are made in that area."_
Now that I think about it, my answer was both bold and pretentious.
But things then went even worse.
I was asked right afterward:
_"So, what do you really want? Is it the act of achieving something extraordinary (like winning the Nobel Prize), or the recognition that comes with it?"_
My answer was something like the following:
_"It's the fact of overcoming challenges that brings me joy. For example, I don't care about the number of paper citations, but I would like to know that I did something remarkable, and it's great when others recognize my achievements."_
In retrospect, what such a pretentious answer that was!
What the hell?
Seeking for "recognition" is clearly a selfish goal.
I wonder why did I answer in that way.
So I've been thinking deeply about this question and my true answer.
To my relief, I realize that I don't really want to be recognized in any way.
What I really want is **to help and inspire others so they can achieve great things!**[^1]
I'm glad I realized that, and I hope to never forget the long road that brought me here.
Or am I starting to forget?
Maybe I should recap how insignificant I am and how much I owe to others.
Maybe it's a good time to my roots.
Seriously.

# Remember...

- Remember that you grew up eating wild frogs from swamps; your father brought and cut the frogs, while your mom fried them and told you it was chicken. Sometimes it is great not knowing about the origin of certain things.
- Remember that your dad grew rice and fed pigs with his arms for many years so that you get the best possible food on your plate every day. He was a great civil engineer, but times were difficult back then.
- Remember that you were the last kid to be chosen when making teams for any sport. You were never fast enough, never strong enough, never talented enough for any sport. It was a big deal for you back then, but now you run 10K with ease and don’t care about such things. It seems that the importance of things is very relative and changes drastically over time, so no worries too much about current failures or limitations, you’ll forget most of them in a few years.
- Remember the real good old days when all the family was together sitting at the same table to celebrate the new year. We played dominó and listened to music from cassettes and later CDs. Those were probably the happiest moments in your life and you didn’t even know.
- Remember your hometown, there were almost no paved roads there, and people used horses as a means of transportation, and that was great because streets were safer so the kids could play baseball in the middle of the road. There is always some good side coming from every difficult situation.
- Remember your grandfather climbing tens of palm trees every single day without safety measures to collect palm nuts to feed the pigs; the palm trees were between 25-30 meters tall. That was truly hard work, and you're only pretending to work in comparison.
- Remember your friends were always the noblest, the least problematic in the classroom, so as you were. There was always some bullish here and there, but you were never alone. It’s important not to be totally alone.
- Remember when cartoons were only one hour or two every day on one of the two available TV channels in the country, and you waited with joy for that moment to watch them in black and white. Waiting for things to happen forges patience and brings great pleasure, instant remuneration is really bad.
- Remember that a few of your preschool friends played in the streets barefoot, but you always wore shoes. You never thought about it and instead wanted the toys of the richest kids. It seems we tend to always look at those who have more and forget about those who have less.
- Remember that you fought other kids many, many times with your fists. It took you a while to understand that a few punches here and there were better than the daily humiliation of being a coward. Later on, you learned that the worst kind of aggression is passive aggression, for which fists don’t work anymore.
- Remember that you were separated from your parents to work on potato plantations for 40 days under child slavery conditions. You were 11, and that seemed normal to you. The perception of what is socially accepted or not is very subjective.
- Remember that day you were sitting on the rooftop along with your father in the middle of one of the common blackouts; he told you there was no hope for the new generations in the country leaving was the best. You understood what it meant for you but not for him to say that. The best people are those who prioritize the happiness of others over their own.
- Remember that you grew up listening to radio stations from the US and dreamed for decades about freedom of speech, a free market where you could buy things without so many regulations. Now you have all of these, but many people still live under dictatorship regimes and die without meeting that kind of freedom.
- Remember the more than 150000 Cubans that have died across the Straits of Florida seeking the same freedom, opportunities, and prosperity y that you enjoy today. Say again: more than 150000 Cubans died. That number should be enough to remind you why your parents chose to resist the communist regime instead of risking their lives in the sea.
- Remember that you have a very bad short-term memory. Indeed, you never managed to memorize the multiplication tables at school but learned to quickly do sums instead. The lack of certain abilities certainly develops others and allows the unleashing of new capabilities.
- Remember that you were a child and once tried to become good at playing chess but soon realized that you were not smart enough for that. You have never been smart enough at any kind of mind game (or at any game at all), and you will probably never be. No big deal, the majority fo people don’t have any special talent, just like you.
- Remember that your parents never knew about the internet, and never used a smartphone, and have certainly no idea about what an AI, blockchain, or even what a PhD is. All of these new stuff were invented quite recently, and for your parents live was simpler. But they were happy in their way. Maybe simplicity is an important component of happiness.
- Remember the immutability of character of your father. Be quiet as a lake, he said. Many years later you learned that staying calm when times are the toughest is what makes bravery.
- Remember when you got admitted into that middle school where the best students went. You managed to get into it by a very narrow margin. Your mom was very happy. Being at that particular school opened new doors and brought opportunities. Education is invaluable and we tend to underestimate its importance at young ages.
- Remember that you are not, and never were, the smartest guy in the classroom; that made you grow. If you are the smartest in the room then you’re in the wrong room, someone said.
- Remember how many writing tests you had at that middle school, you were waked up before 6:00, students washed the dishes and cleaned the school, at the same time you had classes the whole day for 11 days in a row (interchanging with manual work at the orange plantations) and then repeat. Nevertheless, you were extremely lucky to be at that school.
- Remember your father, he was at a completely different level of brain than you, but he never realized his full potential. He was maybe too conservative. You need to work hard and take certain from time to time to achieve something remarkable.
- Remember how lucky you were of being able to skip the mandatory one year military service to spent a year working in a library instead. You were lucky but many others have wasted so much time on such kinds of things, sadly.
- Remember the less popular students became later the most successful adults. You’re biased by social conventions and get blind sometimes to perceive reality in full. You are most often only one insignificant person trying to fit in into  the masses.
- Remember that you studied Computer Science without a PC at hand. You did practically all the exams at university on a piece of paper. Today this is inconceivable, but it forged reasoning.
- Remember that you started learning to code very late (you were 18). Most good engineers of your age in developed countries started to code very early (before 10). You are way behind your peers in terms of practice no matter what, so do not forget that.
- Remember how many exams you failed at university. Sometimes because of being lazy to study, sometimes because you just didn’t get it. It’s surprising that you always managed to pass them on the second chance. Thanks to the education system for giving second chances.
- Remember all the time you wasted playing video games. There was certainly very little value by doing so. You were too young to think about it. Just think about how much value and growth you could have achieved if all that time were invested more wisely. Wasting time is very easy, and we realize it too late.
- Remember to times when you said “no” to enjoyable adventures and preferred to stay home. You  never miss a party with good people, you can do those important things later.

- _TO BE CONTINUED..._
