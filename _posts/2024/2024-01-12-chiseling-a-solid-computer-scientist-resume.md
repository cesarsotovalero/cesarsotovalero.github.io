[//]: # (- I want to help PhD students and other CS professionals to create a good résumé.)
[//]: # (- With a good resumé they will be able to get better job offers.)
[//]: # (- A good resumé will make them feel more confident about their achievements)

A few friends have asked me to give feedback on their résumés.
For context, they are all graduated Computer Science PhDs looking to land a new job in the tech industry.
So they are the cream of the crop, and they resumes should look awesome, right?
Well, not really.
I remember my first résumé was awful (I didn't even have the guts to share it here).
It took me a while to understand how a great résumé looks like.
Building a great résumé takes a lot of time, effort, and conscious planning.
Meaning that it's important to be intentional with what we plan to achieve professionally, and then on how we want to present ourselves to the world.
Indeed, I'm working on improving my résumé every single day!
_But what makes a résumé stand out from the crowd?_
I think of three things: **simplicity**, **solidity**, and **uniqueness**.
This post is about what I meant with these three words.
A good résumé also requires some understanding (and vision) of the job market and the current and future needs of potential employers.
Alright, I also know, there is already a ton of content out there about how to properly craft a résumé.
However, I still want to share **my personal take on this matter**, just because everyone has a different perspective and I like to share mine.
My view, and opinions on this post, are specifically for PhD students and Computer Science professionals.
So in this post, I'll cover how I like to structure a résumé, what content to include, and what (I believe) are common mistakes to avoid.
Hopefully, these tips will help you create a résumé that stands out from the crowd and receive a $200K+ offer (just kidding).
But seriously, a good résumé can make a huge difference in your job search and career development.
And it's very easy to get it right!

# Purpose

[//]: # (TODO - focus on computer scientists )

Ok, so let's start by the ~~obvious~~ fact that a [résumé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9) is a document, meaning it's a set of words put on a page.
Notably, this traditional old-fashioned format has been around for centuries.[^2]
Its primary purpose has always been to present an individual's skills, experience, and qualifications to potential employers.
It serves as a marketing tool that allows job-seekers to showcase their suitability for a certain job.
Résumés aim to make a positive first impression, highlight relevant accomplishments, and secure an interview with the stakeholder.
So it will not get you the job, but almost.

The concept of résumés has evolved over time, reflecting changes in the job market and the expectations of employers.
With the industrial revolution, there was a greater need for workers to present their skills and experience in a more formalized manner.
People changed jobs more frequently, and the qualifications required for different roles became more specialized.
Hence, résumés began to include more structured information about an individual’s work history and education.
The rise of office jobs and corporate culture in the mid-20th century further solidified the importance of résumés.
Employers began to expect well-organized résumés that clearly outlined an applicant's qualifications and experience.

Over time, résumés have also become tools for personal branding.
They not only list qualifications but also reflect an individual’s professional identity, career goals, and unique value proposition.
In today's competitive job market, a well-crafted résumé can make all the difference in securing a job interview.
Or at least, that's the idea.

# Sniping

{% badge /img/posts/2024/2024-01-12/target.png 140 https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/american_english/sniper %}

- Companies hire people because they can immediately bring something to the table and make an impact on a future project. What you did as a research assistant back in 2011 is completely meaningless, especially since your recent research experience is much more impressive.
- The good jobs are never publicly advertised; they are internal. However, you need to start somehow and get inside before seeing them.
- In academia, recommendations are super important. Most people I know got my PhD through a direct recommendation (including myself).
- We need to understand the process depending on the size of the company (ADD A DIAGRAM including HR, HIRING MANAGER, JOB POSTING ADD, INTERNAL AD, etc.)
- A good CV is not a guarantee of anything; ultimately, it just gives you more opportunities to get more interviews.

In the highly competitive tech industry, I suggest adopting the mindset of a sniper when crafting your résumé. 
The essence of this approach is to focus on precision and relevance.
Companies are looking to hire candidates who can immediately contribute and make an impact on future projects.
Therefore, it is crucial to highlight your most recent and significant accomplishments, rather than dwelling on outdated experiences.
For example, detailing your current research projects and their outcomes will be far more compelling than mentioning a research assistant position from a decade ago.

Furthermore, it's important to recognize that the most coveted jobs are often not publicly advertised. 
These positions are typically filled internally or through referrals. 
To gain access to these hidden opportunities, you need to first secure a position within the company.
Networking and leveraging recommendations play a vital role here.
In academia, recommendations are paramount; many PhD graduates, including myself, have secured positions through direct referrals.
Therefore, building a strong network and seeking recommendations can be as important as having a well-crafted résumé.

Understanding the hiring process is also essential, as it varies with the size of the company.
For instance, larger companies may involve multiple stages, including HR screenings, interviews with hiring managers, and internal job postings. 
Smaller companies might have a more streamlined process.
Visualizing this process can be helpful, so consider including a diagram in your preparation materials that outlines the steps from job posting to final hiring. 
Remember, a strong résumé is just the first step; it opens the door to interviews, where you can further demonstrate your fit for the role and ultimately secure the position.

# Structure

{% badge /img/posts/2024/2024-01-12/map.png 140 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award %}

- Give it some structure: (Name, links, Unique skills, education, …)
- You can create two résumés: the first one for the person who is hiring you, and a second one for HR. The HR version could be a boring version of your résumé with the keywords that these non-technical people want to hear.
- The résumé should show me what you have in your soul, what do you want to be. For example, for me, showing that you have taught someone in some course (even children) means that you are driven not only for money but that you really have a love for the profession. It means that you’re giving something back to the community.

When crafting your résumé, it's essential to give it a clear and logical structure. Start with your name and contact information, followed by links to your professional profiles, such as LinkedIn or a personal website showcasing your projects and publications. Next, highlight your unique skills, especially those that align with the job you are applying for. This could include specific programming languages, frameworks, or methodologies that are particularly relevant to the position. Following this, detail your education, emphasizing degrees, certifications, and any honors or awards received. Ensure each section is clearly labeled and easy to navigate, creating a document that is both visually appealing and easy to read.

Consider creating two versions of your résumé: one tailored for the hiring manager and another for the HR department. The version for the hiring manager should emphasize your technical skills and accomplishments, showcasing the depth of your expertise and the impact of your work. Meanwhile, the HR version should include more general keywords and phrases that align with the job description, ensuring it passes through applicant tracking systems (ATS) and resonates with non-technical reviewers. This strategic approach increases the likelihood that your résumé will be noticed by both technical and non-technical personnel involved in the hiring process.

A résumé should also reflect your passion and career aspirations. Beyond listing your technical skills and work experience, include elements that demonstrate your commitment to the field. For instance, mentioning any teaching experiences, whether in formal settings or volunteer roles, shows that you are not only skilled but also dedicated to giving back to the community and fostering growth in others. This can highlight your enthusiasm for the profession and your willingness to contribute beyond the immediate demands of a job, making you a more attractive candidate to potential employers.

# Content

{% badge /img/posts/2024/2024-01-12/parchment.png 140 # %}

- A résumé is a direct commercial proposal.
- The goal is to show something that is extremely unique to you, something that makes you stand out. Something that no one else has.
- I think you should position yourself as if you are super specialized, e.g., “software engineer” is very general, but “database query specialist” is not. The wider the profile, the cheaper you are.
- Experience plus something unique that you created.
- The wider you describe your skills, the worse it is for you. The more narrowed focus, the better because you show specialization.
- It’s super important to me if the person has his own projects; it means he did something himself.
- The text you write should be supported by facts, I love links.

Think of your résumé as a direct commercial proposal where you are the product being marketed. The objective is to showcase what makes you uniquely qualified and indispensable for the role you are applying for. Highlight your distinct achievements and skills that set you apart from other candidates. Whether it's a particular project, a groundbreaking research paper, or a specialized skill, make sure to feature something that is exclusively yours and reflects your unique professional identity. This distinctive element is what will grab the attention of potential employers and make your résumé memorable.

Positioning yourself as a specialist rather than a generalist is key. A broad title like "software engineer" can be too vague and may undervalue your expertise. Instead, narrow down your focus to something more specific, such as "database query specialist" or "machine learning algorithm expert." This specialization not only makes you appear more skilled but also positions you as a premium candidate in your niche. The more precise your skills and experiences are, the more likely you are to stand out in a crowded job market and be perceived as a valuable asset.

Including your own projects is also crucial. Personal projects demonstrate initiative, creativity, and a passion for your field. They show that you are not just working for a paycheck but are genuinely interested in advancing your skills and contributing to the industry. Be sure to include links to these projects, whether they are GitHub repositories, live applications, or detailed case studies. Providing tangible evidence of your work supports the claims you make in your résumé and allows potential employers to see your skills in action. This factual support builds credibility and strengthens your overall proposal.

## Skills

{% badge /img/posts/2024/2024-01-12/medal.png 140 # %}

- I don’t understand when some put Git,[^1] CI/CD, Docker, REST APIs, Python, Unit Tests, backend, frontend, etc., in the list of skills. What does it mean frontend? All these are basic instruments for developers. It’s the same as putting laptop, Firefox, Internet, or coffee. I would recommend adding specific frameworks instead.
- Only put languages that you know if you are really a polyglot (i.e., more than 3 languages). English doesn’t count because you are by default supposed to speak it as a professional. English is a basic skill, the language of international communication, just like GitHub is the place to write software for developers.
- Don’t write the details of the specific software applications you have developed; there’s no need to load the reader with such information.
- I want to see clear numbers, like, for example, for a programmer: “I’ve written 15K LoC in the last 2 years”, “I’ve merged 20 PR in this [Large Project on GitHub].

When it comes to listing skills on your résumé, I often see candidates including basics like Git, CI/CD, Docker, REST APIs, Python, unit tests, backend, frontend, etc. Frankly, this approach misses the mark. These are fundamental tools for developers, akin to listing "laptop," "Firefox," "Internet," or "coffee" as essential items for an office job. Instead, focus on specific frameworks and technologies that demonstrate your depth of knowledge and expertise. For instance, mention frameworks like Django or Flask for Python, React or Angular for frontend development, or Kubernetes for container orchestration. These specifics paint a clearer picture of your capabilities and the environments you excel in.

When it comes to languages, only list those you are truly proficient in, especially if you can claim polyglot status with more than three languages. Remember, English doesn't count; as a professional in the tech industry, proficiency in English is expected. It’s the default language of international communication, just as GitHub is the standard platform for sharing code. By listing only the languages you know well, you avoid diluting your résumé with unnecessary information and instead present a concise and focused skill set.

Another crucial aspect is to avoid overloading your résumé with the minutiae of every software application you've developed. Employers are more interested in the impact and scale of your work than the granular details. Highlight your accomplishments with clear, quantifiable metrics. For example, for a programmer, you might include statements like, "I’ve written 15K lines of code (LoC) in the last two years" or "I’ve merged 20 pull requests in this large project on GitHub." These numbers provide tangible evidence of your contributions and productivity, offering a snapshot of your capabilities and work ethic.

## Qualities

{% badge /img/posts/2024/2024-01-12/brain.png 140 # %}

- Don’t praise yourself, avoid being pretentious. It’s much better if you talk about yourself with extreme modesty rather than with pompousness. Or, what others have to say about you.
- I would respect someone who understands his weaknesses and criticizes himself. For example, I submitted a paper, and it was rejected 3 times because of low quality. I didn’t give up and improved it along the way, so it got accepted on the third attempt. I would respect that kind of assertion.
- Don’t forget to add a **professional** picture. Hiring managers need to see who they will work with. And yes, I’ve heard about some European regulations (and western standards) disallowing this to avoid discrimination, but still.
- I like to provide links to prove all my accomplishments. For example, here and here.
- MOOC courses are unacceptable to me (you’re just decreasing your value or discrediting yourself). I don’t write about it; I only keep a list of them for myself to not forget.

When it comes to highlighting your personal qualities on a résumé, it's important to strike the right tone. Don’t praise yourself excessively or come across as pretentious. It's far more effective to speak about yourself with modesty and let your achievements and experiences speak for themselves. Better yet, include testimonials or references from colleagues and mentors who can vouch for your skills and character. This third-party validation often carries more weight than self-praise and provides a more credible and balanced view of your professional persona.

I have great respect for individuals who acknowledge their weaknesses and demonstrate a willingness to learn and grow. For instance, sharing a story about how you submitted a paper that was rejected multiple times but eventually got accepted after significant revisions shows resilience and a commitment to improvement. This kind of honest self-assessment not only highlights your perseverance but also shows that you are open to feedback and dedicated to professional growth. Such transparency can be very appealing to potential employers.

Including a professional picture is another crucial element, despite some regional regulations against it to avoid discrimination. A clear, professional photo helps hiring managers visualize who they might be working with and can make your application more memorable. Alongside your picture, provide links to verify your accomplishments. Whether it’s a link to a published paper, a successful project, or a professional profile, these links serve as concrete evidence of your achievements. However, I would advise against listing MOOC courses. While they are excellent for personal growth, mentioning them on your résumé might detract from your formal education and professional experience. Keep track of them for your own reference, but focus your résumé on more substantial credentials and accomplishments.

## Passions

{% badge /img/posts/2024/2024-01-12/hearth.png 140 # %}

- I would like to see what you are passionate about. For example, if you are a programmer, I would like to see that you have a GitHub account with some projects.
- I would like to see that you are not only a programmer but also a person who is interested in something else. For example, you are a programmer, but you also like to play the guitar, or you are a programmer, but you also like to cook. It means that you are a person who is interested in something else, and you are not just a robot who is only interested in programming.
- Demostrate consistency in your passions. For example, if you are a programmer, I would like to see that you have been programming for a long time, and you have been doing it consistently. It means that you are a person who is interested in programming, and you are not just a person who is interested in programming for a short period of time.

When reviewing a résumé, I always look for indications of what you are passionate about. If you are a programmer, having a GitHub account with a few projects is a fantastic way to showcase your dedication to coding. It tells me that you are not just doing it for a paycheck but genuinely enjoy creating and sharing your work with the community. These projects can serve as tangible proof of your skills and enthusiasm, giving me a deeper insight into what drives you professionally.

However, I also appreciate seeing that you have interests outside of programming. It’s important to demonstrate that you are a well-rounded individual with diverse passions. For instance, if you enjoy playing the guitar or cooking, mention these hobbies. It shows that you have a life beyond the screen and that you bring a variety of experiences and perspectives to your work. Being passionate about different things can make you more creative and resilient, traits that are highly valuable in any profession.

Consistency in your passions is another crucial factor. I want to see that your interest in programming, or any other field, is not just a passing phase. If you've been consistently programming for many years, it shows commitment and a deep-seated interest in your craft. This consistency indicates that you are likely to be dedicated and reliable in your professional endeavors as well. It’s not just about what you do; it’s about how long and how passionately you’ve been doing it. Demonstrating this long-term commitment to your passions makes you a more compelling candidate and paints a fuller picture of who you are.

# Common Mistakes

{% badge /img/posts/2024/2024-01-12/red-flag.png 140 # %}

- No use HeadHunter or any other automatic résumé builder websites. Each résumé should be unique. A public templated résumé lowers the karma of the reviewer automatically. And of course, I understand a unique résumé has a unique structure, thus forcing the recruiter to do some mental work to understand it. The counter to this is making it as short as possible (1 page max).
- You're gonna hate this, but cut it down to one page. Get rid of all publications. The entire last page can be summarized in one bullet point, "Numerous academic publications, talks, and conference presentations. Complete list available at my LinkedIn". Same with teaching experience, that could all be one bullet point.
- Should be one page; no one reads more than that, written concisely.
- Nobody really cares about online certificates; just list your PhD for education, again one bullet point.
- Adding a non-tech experience (plumbing) is like shooting yourself in the foot.
- If you put freelancing anywhere there, you put yourself in the category of people who don’t know how to have a full-time job.
- It’s better not to mention the university where you graduated from unless it is a really well-known university with a very good reputation.
- I believe that changing companies too frequently is not a good sign. As an employer, I will say the minimum time is three years. This is because normally companies that are large invest a lot of time at the beginning, teaching you the system.
- Having changed jobs too frequently means that you are unstable as an employee.
- Don’t pretend that you are a senior researcher if you don’t have papers to show.
- Don’t try to seem more experienced than what you really are; it only worsens the impression. For example, if you have only 1 year of experience, then it’s impossible to know more than 3 technologies really in-depth. Like if you put ML in Python, TensorFlow, I’m tempted to ask you if you have contributed to TensorFlow on GitHub.

In my years of reviewing résumés, I've seen a fair share of common mistakes that candidates make, which can significantly impact their chances of landing a job. One of the first things I advise against is using HeadHunter or any other automatic résumé builder websites. Each résumé should be unique and tailored to the specific job you’re applying for. A public templated résumé often lacks personality and lowers the reviewer's impression. Although a unique résumé may force the recruiter to do some mental work to understand it, the key is to make it as short and clear as possible, ideally one page. This approach ensures that your résumé stands out without overwhelming the reader.

You're probably not going to like this, but cutting your résumé down to one page is crucial. I understand the challenge, especially for those with extensive academic and teaching backgrounds. However, it's essential to be concise. You can summarize the entire last page of publications with a single bullet point: "Numerous academic publications, talks, and conference presentations. Complete list available at my LinkedIn." The same goes for teaching experience; consolidate it into one bullet point. No one reads more than one page, so make sure every word counts.

Another common mistake is listing online certificates. While they are valuable for personal development, they don’t carry much weight in the professional world compared to your PhD. Simply listing your PhD under education is often sufficient. Including non-tech experiences, like plumbing, is also a misstep. It distracts from your relevant skills and can give the impression that you’re not focused on your tech career. Similarly, mentioning freelancing can sometimes work against you. It might suggest that you’re not accustomed to the demands of a full-time job, which could be a red flag for some employers.

When it comes to your educational background, only mention the university you graduated from if it’s well-known with a solid reputation. Otherwise, it’s better to focus on your qualifications and achievements. Additionally, frequent job changes can be a major red flag. Employers typically look for a minimum of three years at each company. This stability indicates that you’ve had enough time to learn and contribute significantly. Changing jobs too frequently can make you appear unstable and unreliable.

It’s also important to be honest about your experience level. Don’t claim to be a senior researcher if you don’t have the papers to back it up. Exaggerating your experience can worsen the impression you make. For example, if you only have one year of experience, it’s unrealistic to claim expertise in more than three technologies. If you list Machine Learning in Python, TensorFlow, and other advanced skills, be prepared to substantiate your knowledge with contributions to projects like TensorFlow on GitHub.


# Conclusion

The résumé has evolved from a simple letter of skills and experience to a complex and dynamic document that plays a crucial role in the job application process. Its primary purpose remains the same: to connect job seekers with potential employers by effectively communicating their qualifications and suitability for a the job.
In conclusion, writing a résumé is about balancing brevity with detail, honesty with ambition, and uniqueness with clarity. Avoid these common mistakes, and you’ll be on your way to crafting a résumé that truly stands out and resonates with potential employers.
