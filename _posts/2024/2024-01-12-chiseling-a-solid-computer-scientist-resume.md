[//]: # (- I want to help PhD students and other CS professionals to create a good résumé.)
[//]: # (- With a good resumé they will be able to get better job offers.)
[//]: # (- A good resumé will make them feel more confident about their achievements)

Once in a while, a few friends have asked me to give feedback on their résumés.
They are graduated Computer Science PhDs looking to land a new job in the tech industry.
And I know, building a great résumé takes a lot of time, planning, and effort.
Indeed, I'm working on improving mine all the time!
_But what makes a résumé stand out from the crowd?_
I think of three things: simplicity, solidity, and uniqueness.
A good résumé also requires some understanding (and vision) of the job market and the current and future needs of potential employers.
Alright, I also know, there is already a ton of content out there about how to properly craft a résumé.
However, I still want to share **my personal take on this matter**, just because everyone has a different perspective and I like to share mine.
My view, and opinions, are specifically for PhD students and other Computer Science professionals.
So in this post, I'll cover how I like to structure a résumé, what content to include, and what (I believe) are common mistakes to avoid.
Hopefully, these tips will help you create a résumé that stands out from the crowd and receive a $200K+ offer (just kidding).
But seriously, a good résumé can make a huge difference in your job search and career development.
And it's very easy to get it right!

# Purpose

[//]: # (TODO - focus on computer scientists )

Ok, so let's start by the ~~obvious~~ fact that a [résumé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9) is a document, meaning it's a set of words put on a page.
Notably, this traditional old-fashioned format has been around for centuries.[^2]
Its primary purpose has always been to present an individual's skills, experience, and qualifications to potential employers.
It serves as a marketing tool that allows job-seekers to showcase their suitability for a certain job.
Résumés aim to make a positive first impression, highlight relevant accomplishments, and secure an interview with the stakeholder.
So it will not get you the job, but almost.

The concept of résumés has evolved over time, reflecting changes in the job market and the expectations of employers.
With the industrial revolution, there was a greater need for workers to present their skills and experience in a more formalized manner.
People changed jobs more frequently, and the qualifications required for different roles became more specialized.
Hence, résumés began to include more structured information about an individual’s work history and education.
The rise of office jobs and corporate culture in the mid-20th century further solidified the importance of résumés.
Employers began to expect well-organized résumés that clearly outlined an applicant's qualifications and experience.

Over time, résumés have also become tools for personal branding.
They not only list qualifications but also reflect an individual’s professional identity, career goals, and unique value proposition.
In today's competitive job market, a well-crafted résumé can make all the difference in securing a job interview.
Or at least, that's the idea.

# Sniping

I suggest being an sniper.

- Companies hire people because they can immediately bring something to the table and make an impact on a future project. What you did as a research assistant back in 2011 is completely meaningless, especially since your recent research experience is much more impressive.
- The good jobs are never publicly advertised; they are internal. However, you need to start somehow and get inside before seeing them.
- In academia, recommendations are super important. Most people I know got my PhD through a direct recommendation (including myself).
- We need to understand the process depending on the size of the company (ADD A DIAGRAM including HR, HIRING MANAGER, JOB POSTING ADD, INTERNAL AD, etc.)
- A good CV is not a guarantee of anything; ultimately, it just gives you more opportunities to get more interviews.


# Structure

- Give it some structure: (Name, links, Unique skills, education, …)
- You can create two résumés: the first one for the person who is hiring you, and a second one for HR. The HR version could be a boring version of your résumé with the keywords that these non-technical people want to hear.
- The résumé should show me what you have in your soul, what do you want to be. For example, for me, showing that you have taught someone in some course (even children) means that you are driven not only for money but that you really have a love for the profession. It means that you’re giving something back to the community.

# Content

- A résumé is a direct commercial proposal.
- The goal is to show something that is extremely unique to you, something that makes you stand out. Something that no one else has.
- I think you should position yourself as if you are super specialized, e.g., “software engineer” is very general, but “database query specialist” is not. The wider the profile, the cheaper you are.
- Experience plus something unique that you created.
- The wider you describe your skills, the worse it is for you. The more narrowed focus, the better because you show specialization.
- It’s super important to me if the person has his own projects; it means he did something himself.
- The text you write should be supported by facts, I love links.

## Skills

- I don’t understand when some put Git,[^1] CI/CD, Docker, REST APIs, Python, Unit Tests, backend, frontend, etc., in the list of skills. What does it mean frontend? All these are basic instruments for developers. It’s the same as putting laptop, Firefox, Internet, or coffee. I would recommend adding specific frameworks instead.
- Only put languages that you know if you are really a polyglot (i.e., more than 3 languages). English doesn’t count because you are by default supposed to speak it as a professional. English is a basic skill, the language of international communication, just like GitHub is the place to write software for developers.
- Don’t write the details of the specific software applications you have developed; there’s no need to load the reader with such information.
- I want to see clear numbers, like, for example, for a programmer: “I’ve written 15K LoC in the last 2 years”, “I’ve merged 20 PR in this [Large Project on GitHub].

## Qualities

- Don’t praise yourself, avoid being pretentious. It’s much better if you talk about yourself with extreme modesty rather than with pompousness. Or, what others have to say about you.
- I would respect someone who understands his weaknesses and criticizes himself. For example, I submitted a paper, and it was rejected 3 times because of low quality. I didn’t give up and improved it along the way, so it got accepted on the third attempt. I would respect that kind of assertion.
- Don’t forget to add a **professional** picture. Hiring managers need to see who they will work with. And yes, I’ve heard about some European regulations (and western standards) disallowing this to avoid discrimination, but still.
- I like to provide links to prove all my accomplishments. For example, here and here.
- MOOC courses are unacceptable to me (you’re just decreasing your value or discrediting yourself). I don’t write about it; I only keep a list of them for myself to not forget.

## Passions

- I would like to see what you are passionate about. For example, if you are a programmer, I would like to see that you have a GitHub account with some projects.
- I would like to see that you are not only a programmer but also a person who is interested in something else. For example, you are a programmer, but you also like to play the guitar, or you are a programmer, but you also like to cook. It means that you are a person who is interested in something else, and you are not just a robot who is only interested in programming.
- Demostrate consistency in your passions. For example, if you are a programmer, I would like to see that you have been programming for a long time, and you have been doing it consistently. It means that you are a person who is interested in programming, and you are not just a person who is interested in programming for a short period of time.

# Common Mistakes

- No use HeadHunter or any other automatic résumé builder websites. Each résumé should be unique. A public templated résumé lowers the karma of the reviewer automatically. And of course, I understand a unique résumé has a unique structure, thus forcing the recruiter to do some mental work to understand it. The counter to this is making it as short as possible (1 page max).
- You're gonna hate this, but cut it down to one page. Get rid of all publications. The entire last page can be summarized in one bullet point, "Numerous academic publications, talks, and conference presentations. Complete list available at my LinkedIn". Same with teaching experience, that could all be one bullet point.
- Should be one page; no one reads more than that, written concisely.
- Nobody really cares about online certificates; just list your PhD for education, again one bullet point.
- Adding a non-tech experience (plumbing) is like shooting yourself in the foot.
- If you put freelancing anywhere there, you put yourself in the category of people who don’t know how to have a full-time job.
- It’s better not to mention the university where you graduated from unless it is a really well-known university with a very good reputation.
- I believe that changing companies too frequently is not a good sign. As an employer, I will say the minimum time is three years. This is because normally companies that are large invest a lot of time at the beginning, teaching you the system.
- Having changed jobs too frequently means that you are unstable as an employee.
- Don’t pretend that you are a senior researcher if you don’t have papers to show.
- Don’t try to seem more experienced than what you really are; it only worsens the impression. For example, if you have only 1 year of experience, then it’s impossible to know more than 3 technologies really in-depth. Like if you put ML in Python, TensorFlow, I’m tempted to ask you if you have contributed to TensorFlow on GitHub.


# Conclusion

The résumé has evolved from a simple letter of skills and experience to a complex and dynamic document that plays a crucial role in the job application process. Its primary purpose remains the same: to connect job seekers with potential employers by effectively communicating their qualifications and suitability for a j
job.

# Footnotes

[^1]: I thinks just a small number of developers are really good at Git. Most only know a few commands and that’s. If uou star digging deep then you will understand that they don’t really know. 

[^2]: résumés have been around for centuries. One of the [first résumés in human history](https://résuméspice.com/the-history-of-the-professional-résumé/) is attributed to Leonardo da Vinci. In 1482, he wrote a letter to Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan, outlining his skills and offering his services as a military engineer. This letter is often considered the first recorded résumé.
