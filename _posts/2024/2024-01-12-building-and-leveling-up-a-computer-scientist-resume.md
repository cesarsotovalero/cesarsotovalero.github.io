Recently, a few friends have asked me to give them feedback on their r√©sum√©s. 
They are all Computer Science PhD graduates looking to land a new job in the tech industry. 
You might think these people are the cream of the crop, so their r√©sum√©s should look awesome, right? 
Well, not really. 
Most graduate students are just as na√Øve as I two years ago when I started to play outside academia.
I remember my first r√©sum√© was awful (I don't even have the guts to share it here).
I had no experience writing r√©sum√©s, and it took me a while to understand what a great one looks like.
Now I know that building an awesome r√©sum√© takes time, effort, and conscious planning. 
Now, if you ask me the question: 
_What makes a r√©sum√© stand out from the crowd?_ 
I think of three things: **simplicity**, **solidity**, and **uniqueness**. 
This post revolves about what I mean by this.
Alright, I know there is already a ton of content out there about how to properly craft a r√©sum√©. 
However, I still want to share **my personal take on this matter**.
One reason is that topic is subjective, so everyone has a different perspective, so why not sharing mine?
To narrow it down, my views and opinions in this post are specifically for PhD students and Computer Science professionals. 
So in this post, I'll cover how I would envision and structure the r√©sum√© of a scientist.
This includes what content to include, and what I believe are common mistakes to avoid.
Hopefully, if you're working on yours, these tips will help you create a r√©sum√© that's strong, powerful, memorable, and catchy; and then receive a $200K+ offer (just kidding).
But seriously, a good r√©sum√© can make a huge difference in your job search and career development.
And it's not so hard to get it right when having the right scores!

# Purpose

{% badge /img/posts/2024/2024-01-12/leveled-up.png 140 https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1awyypu/my_diablo_1_level_50_warrior_after_12_years/ %}

The traditional [r√©sum√©](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9) is a document, essentially a collection of words on a page.
Interestingly, this old-fashioned format has been around for centuries, surviving the test of time.[^2]
Sure, I know it's a digital PDF now, but the essence remains the same.
Its primary purpose has always been to present an individual's **skills**, **experience**, and **qualifications** to potential employers.

When I think of a r√©sum√©, I can't avoid remembering the skills and inventory of items from the original [Diablo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_(video_game)) RPG game, which I played 20 years ago.
I imagine the r√©sum√© is the skill set, each having a certain score.
A big part of the game is developing the character by levelling up his skills over time.
As in real life, this can only be accomplished through experience.
Essentially, it all comes down to overcoming new challenges and exploring new territories.
Similarly, a r√©sum√© is something that we can advance from level to level in order to unlock more possibilities.
It's constantly improving.
Indeed, I'm technically working on my r√©sum√© every single day!

So, ultimately, the purpose of a r√©sum√© is signal professional growing, and also serving sometimes as a marketing tool.
This is the document we are gonna send every time we want to demonstrate our suitability for a particular job.
Thus, the aim is to make a positive first impression, highlight relevant accomplishments, and secure an interview with the potential employer.
This means it's important to be intentional about our professional goals and how we want to present ourselves to the world.

I think a good r√©sum√© requires an understanding (and vision) of the job market.
Its purpose should reflect the current and future market's needs in our profession.
So, it's a live document, which we constantly evolve over time.
I think that, while a r√©sum√© alone won't get you the job, it can get you very close by unlocking opportunities get more interview.
But of course, it only works out its purpose when it is done right.

# Marksmanship

{% badge /img/posts/2024/2024-01-12/target.png 140 https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/american_english/sniper %}

As I've seen, computer scientists are hired based on an assessment of their capacity to bring something new to the table.
The most important is proving that one can make an **immediate impact** on a certain project.
Thus, in the highly competitive tech industry, I believe in adopting the mindset of a sniper preparing the r√©sum√©.
This mean taking the role of as a specialist rather than a generalist.

I believe it's good being as specific as possible and thinking from the perspective of the hiring person.
For example, what I did as a research assistant, or at that technical training back in 2013 is completely irrelevant today.
Recent experience is much more important!
So I would rather highlight the  most recent and significant accomplishments, rather than dwelling on outdated experiences.

```

The most coveted jobs are ~~almost~~ never publicly advertised.
These positions are typically filled internally or through referrals.
So, networking and recommendations are super important.
Indeed, in academia, recommendations are paramount.
Many PhD graduates, including myself, have secured positions through direct referrals.
Therefore, building a strong network and seeking recommendations can be as important as having a well-crafted r√©sum√©.

The marksmanship resume is focused on precision and relevance.
To gain access to hidden opportunities, we need to first secure a position within the company.
However, I also know that we all need to start somehow and get inside before actually seeing those opportunities.
Understanding the hiring process is also essential, as it varies with the size of the company.
For instance, larger companies may involve multiple stages, including HR screenings, interviews with hiring managers, and internal job postings. 
Smaller companies might have a more streamlined process.

# Structure

{% badge /img/posts/2024/2024-01-12/map.png 140 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award %}

When crafting a r√©sum√©, presentation and structure are very important.
For presentation I suggest using a $ \LaTeX $ and tweaking it to make it personal and unique.
Each section should be clearly labeled and easy to read.

Regarding structure, I would include the following, from top to down:

1. Name, contact information, and smiling picture.
2. Links to professional profiles (e.g., LinkedIn or a personal website showcasing projects and publications)
3. Highlight of unique skills, especially those that align with the job you are applying for. This could include specific programming languages, frameworks, or methodologies that are particularly relevant to the position. 
4. Detail your education, emphasizing degrees, certifications, and any honors or awards received.
5. Hobbies or particular skills outside the regular job (for example, if you are a polyglot or engaged in a particular sport).

I would also recommend  creating two versions of the r√©sum√©: one tailored for the hiring manager and another for the HR department.
This strategic approach increases the likelihood that a r√©sum√© will be noticed by both technical and non-technical personnel involved in the hiring process.

The hiring manager can understand the depth of your expertise and the impact of your work.
Thus, the version for her should emphasize technical skills and accomplishments.
For example, if you got a best paper award in a conference, make sure to explain why is hard (with estimate percentage of people who get it) and valuable (why is such a significant achievement in terms of outreach).

Meanwhile, the HR version could be the boring version and include more general keywords and phrases that align with the job description.
This would help to ensuring it passes through [applicant tracking systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicant_tracking_system) and resonates with non-technical people.
For example, the boring version could have many pages and list all your papers, grades, conferences, even hackathons, and other activities done in the past 5 years.  

# Content

{% badge /img/posts/2024/2024-01-12/parchment.png 140 # %}

Think of your r√©sum√© as a direct commercial proposal in which you are the product being marketed.

For a product to hit the mark, it should have something that is extremely unique to it, something that makes it stand out from the competition. 
For a r√©sum√©, I believe the first line of accomplishment should be something that no one else (or only a few people) has and is relevant for the role you're applying to.
For example, if applying for an R&D position in a Machine Learning field and you have won a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions), then I would put that on top, because no one else has it. 
Again, the goal is to highlight distinct achievements and skills that set you apart from other candidates. 
Whether it's a particular project with many GitHub stars, a highly-cited research paper, or a particularly unusual skill, make sure to feature something that is exclusively yours and reflects your unique professional identity.
This distinctive element is what will grab the attention of potential employers and make your r√©sum√© memorable.

Positioning yourself as a specialist rather than a generalist is key.

I think you should position yourself as if you are super specialized.
A broad title like "software engineer" can be too vague and may undervalue your expertise. 
Instead, narrow down your focus to something more specific, such as "database query specialist" or "machine learning algorithm expert." 
This specialization not only makes you appear more skilled but also positions you as a premium candidate in your niche. 
The more precise your skills and experiences are, the more likely you are to stand out in a crowded job market and be perceived as a valuable asset.

Technical hiring managers understand the value of personal projects on GitHub.

I believe that having own projects is still undervalued in the market.
A personal project it means that the person has done something herself.
It demonstrates initiative, creativity, and a passion for the craft. 
Personal projects also show that you are not just working for a paycheck but are genuinely interested in advancing your skills and contributing to the industry. 
Be sure to include links to these projects, whether they are GitHub repositories, live applications, or detailed case studies.

Your GitHub account and Google Scholar are your portfolio as a computer scientist.  

All written in the r√©sum√© should be supported by facts (I love hyperlinks).
For example, instead of saying "published research papers", it should "published `X` research papers in journals like `Y`, with `Z` citations in total".
These are evidence of your work, it supports the claims made in the r√©sum√© and allows potential employers to see the skills in action.
Facts build credibility and strengthens the overall proposal.

## Skills

{% badge /img/posts/2024/2024-01-12/medal.png 140 # %}

When it comes to listing skills on your r√©sum√©, I often see candidates including basics like Git,[^1] CI/CD, Docker, REST APIs, Python, unit tests, backend, frontend, etc. 
Frankly, this approach misses the mark.
_What does it mean frontend?_
These are basic instruments that all developers should have, akin to listing "laptop," "Firefox," "Internet," or "coffee" as essential items for an office job.
Instead, focus on specific frameworks and technologies that demonstrate your depth of knowledge and expertise. 
For instance, mention frameworks like Django or Flask for Python, React or Angular for frontend development, or Kubernetes for container orchestration.
These specifics paint a clearer picture of your capabilities and the environments you excel in.

When it comes to languages, only list those you are truly proficient in, especially if you can claim polyglot status with more than three languages.
English doesn't count because you are (as a professional in tech industry) by default expected to be proficient.
English is a basic skill, the language of international communication, just like GitHub is the place to share code.
By listing only the languages you know well, you avoid diluting your r√©sum√© with unnecessary information and instead present a concise and focused skill set.

Another crucial aspect is to avoid overloading your r√©sum√© with the minutiae of every software application you've developed. 
Employers are more interested in the impact and scale of your work than the granular details. 
Highlight your accomplishments with clear, quantifiable metrics. For example, for a programmer, you might include statements like, "I‚Äôve written 15K lines of code (LoC) in the last two years" or "I‚Äôve merged 20 pull requests in this large project on GitHub." 
These numbers provide tangible evidence of your contributions and productivity, offering a snapshot of your capabilities and work ethic.

## Qualities

{% badge /img/posts/2024/2024-01-12/brain.png 140 # %}



When it comes to highlighting your personal qualities on a r√©sum√©, it's important to strike the right tone.
Don‚Äôt praise yourself excessively or come across as pretentious. 
It's far more effective to speak about yourself with modesty and let your achievements and experiences speak for themselves. 
Only if needed, include testimonials or references from colleagues and mentors who can vouch for your skills and character. 
This third-party validation often carries more weight than self-praise and provides a more credible and balanced view of your professional persona.

I think it's actually good when someone talks about his weaknesses and criticizes himself.
I have great respect for individuals who acknowledge their weaknesses and demonstrate a willingness to learn and grow. 
For instance, sharing a story about how you submitted a paper that was rejected multiple times because of low quality.
Something like: "_I submitted a paper, and it was rejected two times, I didn't give up and improved it along the way, so it got accepted on the third attempt_." 
I would respect that kind of assertion. 
This kind of honest self-assessment not only highlights your perseverance but also shows that you are open to feedback and dedicated to professional growth. Such transparency can be very appealing to potential employers.

I believe that including a professional picture is important, despite some regional regulations against it to avoid discrimination.[^3]
Hiring managers need to see who they will work with.
A clear, professional photo helps hiring managers visualize who they might be working with and can make your application more memorable.
Alongside your picture, provide links to verify your accomplishments. 
Whether it‚Äôs a link to a published paper, a successful project, or a professional profile, these links serve as concrete evidence of your achievements. 
However, I would advise against listing MOOC courses (you‚Äôre just decreasing your value or discrediting yourself). 
While they are excellent for personal growth, mentioning them on your r√©sum√© might detract from your formal education and professional experience.
I only keep [my own list of online MOOCs](../courses.html) for myself to not forget.
Focus your r√©sum√© on more substantial credentials and accomplishments.

## Passions

{% badge /img/posts/2024/2024-01-12/hearth.png 140 # %}

When reviewing a r√©sum√©, I always look for indications of what you are passionate about. 
If you are a programmer, having a GitHub account with a few projects is a fantastic way to showcase your dedication to coding. 
It tells me that you are not just doing it for a paycheck but genuinely enjoy creating and sharing your work with the community. 
These projects can serve as tangible proof of your skills and enthusiasm, giving me a deeper insight into what drives you professionally.

However, I also appreciate seeing that you have interests outside of programming.
It‚Äôs important to demonstrate that you are a well-rounded individual with diverse passions. 
For instance, if you enjoy playing the guitar or cooking, mention these hobbies. 
It shows that you have a life beyond the screen and that you bring a variety of experiences and perspectives to your work.
Being passionate about different things can make you more creative and resilient, traits that are highly valuable in any profession.

Consistency in your passions is another crucial factor. 
I want to see that your interest in programming, or any other field, is not just a passing phase. 
If you've been consistently programming for many years, it shows commitment and a deep-seated interest in your craft. 
This consistency indicates that you are likely to be dedicated and reliable in your professional endeavors as well. 
It‚Äôs not just about what you do; it‚Äôs about how long and how passionately you‚Äôve been doing it.
Demonstrating this long-term commitment to your passions makes you a more compelling candidate and paints a fuller picture of who you are.

A r√©sum√© should also reflect your passion and career aspirations.
Beyond listing your technical skills and work experience, I suggest including elements that demonstrate commitment to the field.
For example, for me, showing that you have taught someone in some course (even if it is for children) or contribute to some really popular open-source project (10K stars or more on GitHub) means that you are driven not only for money but that you really have a love for the profession.
It means that you‚Äôre giving something back to the community.
This can highlight your enthusiasm for the profession and your willingness to contribute beyond the immediate demands of a job, making you a more attractive candidate to potential employers.

# Common Mistakes

{% badge /img/posts/2024/2024-01-12/red-flag.png 140 # %}

In my years of reviewing r√©sum√©s, I've seen a fair share of common mistakes that candidates make, which can significantly impact their chances of landing a job. 
One of the first things I advise against is using HeadHunter or any other automatic r√©sum√© builder websites. 
Each r√©sum√© should be unique and tailored to the specific job you‚Äôre applying for. 
A public templated r√©sum√© often lacks personality and lowers the reviewer's impression. 
Although a unique r√©sum√© may force the recruiter to do some mental work to understand it, the key is to make it as short and clear as possible, ideally one page. 
This approach ensures that your r√©sum√© stands out without overwhelming the reader.

You're probably not going to like this, but cutting your r√©sum√© down to one page is crucial. 
I understand the challenge, especially for those with extensive academic and teaching backgrounds. 
However, it's essential to be concise. You can summarize the entire last page of publications with a single bullet point: "Numerous academic publications, talks, and conference presentations. Complete list available at my LinkedIn." 
The same goes for teaching experience; consolidate it into one bullet point. No one reads more than one page, so make sure every word counts.

Another common mistake is listing online certificates. 
While they are valuable for personal development, they don‚Äôt carry much weight in the professional world compared to your PhD. 
Simply listing your PhD under education is often sufficient. Including non-tech experiences, like plumbing, is also a misstep. 
It distracts from your relevant skills and can give the impression that you‚Äôre not focused on your tech career. 
Similarly, mentioning freelancing can sometimes work against you. 
It might suggest that you‚Äôre not accustomed to the demands of a full-time job, which could be a red flag for some employers.

When it comes to your educational background, only mention the university you graduated from if it‚Äôs well-known with a solid reputation. 
Otherwise, it‚Äôs better to focus on your qualifications and achievements. 
Additionally, frequent job changes can be a major red flag. 
Employers typically look for a minimum of three years at each company. 
This stability indicates that you‚Äôve had enough time to learn and contribute significantly. 
Changing jobs too frequently can make you appear unstable and unreliable.

It‚Äôs also important to be honest about your experience level. 
Don‚Äôt claim to be a senior researcher if you don‚Äôt have the papers to back it up. 
Exaggerating your experience can worsen the impression you make. 
For example, if you only have one year of experience, it‚Äôs unrealistic to claim expertise in more than three technologies.
If you list Machine Learning in Python, TensorFlow, and other advanced skills, be prepared to substantiate your knowledge with contributions to projects like TensorFlow on GitHub.


# Conclusion

I think the world has changed fundamentally in the last decades.
Consider two persons with the same grades and same qualifications.
One of them applies for a job with the traditional ~~boring~~ resum√©, she jumped from company `X` to `Y` to `Z` every 3 to 5 years.
Now the other has published research papers, been reached on the local media, and has 100K followers.
Which one do you think has more changes to get the job?
The answer (I think) is the second person.
And the reason is not the number of followers.
It's the original, valuable, content that this person has already proven that she can create.
This person has already practiced and been validated, in public.
(Before the internet the validator was the neighbour).

So, in the near future... whatr wharever potential employer would like to see is the person who they want to hire is doing the thing in the increasingly valuable digital world.
I think the single most valuable skill of the next two decades is creating content online.
So I believe that that a public (online) body of work is replacing the traditional resum√©.
And I love that, because resumes suck at demonstrating actual skills and abilities.

The concept of r√©sum√©s has evolved over time, reflecting changes in the job market and the expectations of employers.
With the industrial revolution, there was a greater need for workers to present their skills and experience in a more formalized manner.
People changed jobs more frequently, and the qualifications required for different roles became more specialized.
Hence, r√©sum√©s began to include more structured information about an individual‚Äôs work history and education.
The rise of office jobs and corporate culture in the mid-20th century further solidified the importance of r√©sum√©s.
Employers began to expect well-organized r√©sum√©s that clearly outlined an applicant's qualifications and experience.

Over time, r√©sum√©s have also become tools for personal branding.
They not only list qualifications but also reflect an individual‚Äôs professional identity, career goals, and unique value proposition.
In today's competitive job market, a well-crafted r√©sum√© can make all the difference in securing a job interview.
Or at least, that's the idea.


The r√©sum√© has evolved from a simple letter of skills and experience to a complex and dynamic document that plays a crucial role in the job application process. Its primary purpose remains the same: to connect job seekers with potential employers by effectively communicating their qualifications and suitability for the job.
In conclusion, writing a r√©sum√© is about balancing brevity with detail, honesty with ambition, and uniqueness with clarity. Avoid these common mistakes, and you‚Äôll be on your way to crafting a r√©sum√© that truly stands out and resonates with potential employers.
