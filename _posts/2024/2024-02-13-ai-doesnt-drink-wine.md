title: AI Doesn't Drink Wine

  In this post, I argue that AI is not exactly creative as we are. Humans come up with unexpected ideas and behaviors, this is what makes life interesting. Humans have an special way to connect with each other, and AI can't replicate that. AI can't drink wine, but I do (sometimes).

I started to consume and appreciate coffee after I moved to Sweden.
For years, I've been considering the idea of buying a fancy coffee machine.
You know, like those that grind and brews the beans to make various types of coffee.
My main motivation was to save time and at the same time have a wide range of coffee choices.
However, after a while I ended up understanding that the experience of making coffee is as important to me as the coffee itself.
It turns out that I actually enjoy buying the coffee beans, grinding them by hand, putting the coffee in my [moka pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot), and waiting for the dark potion to be ready.
I love that experience, it's a time investment, but that's also good for reducing the frequency of my coffee consumption.
Sure, an automatic machine would save time, but I prefer making coffee myself.
This makes me think about the role of "the human experience" and how AI is going to influence or change it in the future.
The rest of this article is a reflection on this matter and how I think we should deal with it.[^1]

Last week I participated at [Jfokus 2024](https://www.jfokus.se/talks/1661) as a speaker.
The main topic of the conference was the latest advances of AI and how it's going to impact our industry. 
The general tread I noticed is the potential and the many ways in which AI could make everything more efficient for developers. 
It looks like writing code, testing, deploying, documenting, or just creating any kind of digital content will be AI-assisted in the coming years.
So, there's a [notable concern](https://youtu.be/rENT1fDR69I?si=pH27Skp26xXGGp2D) regarding the future need for developers.
Honestly, I find the mere question freaking scary, not only because I'm a developer myself, but also because I think coding is one of the more advanced human endeavours.

Apart from code, today's AI is menacing to automatize every aspect of our lives with the promise of freeing us from seemingly mundane tasks.
My major worry is AI relegating the human aspect of our actions to a secondary role.
Activities like making coffee, enjoying wine, cooking, painting, writing, playing music, making love, or chatting with friends could lose their essence.
Even coding at its core is a human activity in which people contribute following conventions and SVG rules.

After a though or two, I realize that in most aspects of my life, I'm not looking for perfection, I'm rather seeking for the experience.
For example, I had a [great time](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cesarsotovalero_jfokus2024-javacommunity-success-activity-7161289069065338880-ptRZ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) at Jfokus this year, I met a lot of people, and I had a good share of fun.
I could have saved some time and money by watching the talks on YouTube later.
However, I argue that there is little value in doing that because the real value of the conference can only be gotten by being there.
Is participating physically in a conference a mundane task?
I don't think it is, I think it's a big part of its value revolves around the human experience.
I'm afraid that a future powered by AI could irremediably change this perception.

# Promises

AI promises to advance our species to the next level (whatever that means).
For the individual, it involves freeing us from mundane tasks so that we'll have more free time to do whatever we want.
Imagine the kinds of optimizations that an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) system could bring to the table. 
It could, for example, give us exactly what we want without rambling. 
No pain in searching for the right clothes, the right food, the right music, the right movie, the right book, the right partner... you get the idea. 
AI will provide the exact match for our needs.

However, I'm afraid that great technological advances have happened before.
At those times, humans thought they were going to have more free time as well.
Yet, we're still working 40 hours a week (just about the same as our gatherer ancestors did 5 million years ago). 
As humans, we've seen the rise of agriculture, freeing us from the need to hunt and gather.
We've seen the rise of the industrial revolution, freeing us from the need to produce everything by hand.
We've seen the rise of the internet, freeing us from the need to go to the library to find information. 
Do we have more free time now?
Not really.
Human freedom didn't happen back then and probably won't happen now with AI.

I would like to be positive and believe that a 4-hour workweek is closer than ever.
I want to believe in the potential of AI that understands my strengths and weaknesses and helps me to be more efficient. 
But I'm not sure if that's going to happen. Or even if being more efficient would make me happier.
Instead, I think that AI is going to reshape the way we interact with the world, meaning that some new behaviors will be added and others will be removed. There is one in particular that I'm concerned about: the human experience.

# Supremacy

AI systems have the potential to become ubiquitous. 
In contrast with other breakthroughs for which infrastructure had to be built from scratch, AI solutions integrate well with our already deployed digital environment, e.g., mobile phones and IoT devices.
This means that in the case of AI, the potential for adoption is wider than with any other technology.

<aside class="quote">
    <em>“AI poses a solution to many problems, but we're merely starting to discover what we can solve with it.”</em>
</aside>

AI systems like LLMs absorbed all the open knowledge of humanity and started to generate new knowledge from it.
These systems are already being used to solve problems that were previously thought to be very difficult.

Here are a few real examples of applied AI that already impress me:

- **[FIGURE 01 Humanoid Robot](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2024/01/figure-01-humanoid-bot-has-learned-to-make-coffee.html)** that can learn how to make coffee.
- **[AMIE](https://blog.research.google/2024/01/amie-research-ai-system-for-diagnostic_12.html)**, an AI system that outperforms human doctors in every field (including empathy).
- **[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)**, the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool.

Now consider a world in which everything is decided by a super powerful AI system. 
Our daily activities would be much more efficient. 
Would it be interesting to live in such a world from a human perspective?
I'm not sure.

We have seen ML systems taking over our decision-making process before.
For example, let's take a look at the [Netflix recommendation system](https://research.netflix.com/research-area/recommendations). 
It enhances customer engagement, which is great from a business perspective, but I don't feel that it's particularly good for viewers at large.
Not to mention our current struggling with social media and the [filter bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble).

<aside class="quote">
    <em>“I'm biased towards human interaction; I'm biased towards the human experience.”</em>
</aside>

We already have [VTubers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTuber), and many forms of AI-generated "art" like music, books, movies, and games. 
However, AI content somehow feels different to me compared to traditional human creativity.
Indeed, I personally experience some kind of aversion to AI-generated content.
For some reason, when I notice that it's AI-generated, I immediately lose interest.

I wish it could be like a personal choice.
Do we even have the right to decide how much do we want to get involved with AI?
The answer is no.
Just like the internet, AI is going to be everywhere and reign supreme.

# Acceptance

Let's accept the reality.
Let's us fully embrace AI for a moment. 
Let's say AI comes up with a decision.
You have no other option other than accept it.
How comfortable are you today with the fact that you're not in control anymore?

For example, what about an AI selecting candidates for a job?
Or an AI deciding who goes to jail and who doesn't?
It's coming.

On the other hand, the things that we thought were inherently human, like art and creativity, are now replicable by AI.
Look at the stuff created by [Midjourney.](https://www.midjourney.com/home), it's just mind-blowing. 

Today we have human teachers dealing with 10 or more children at the same time.
An AI that can bring personalized education experience to every child in the world.
An AI tutor could be really revolutionary.

# The Human Experience

My generation has already made the choice of making the [internet the new electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Internet_access).
For example, today, you can buy clothes without ever meeting the seller in person.
AI is just taking it further, right?
But how much of the human experience are we sacrificing for AI's efficiencies, which are widely accepted?

<aside class="quote">
    <em>“[Some of] the best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads. That sucks.”</em>
    ― <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Hammerbacher">Jeff Hammerbacher</a></cite>
</aside>

If you go to a bar, you might encounter AI bartenders, telling you exactly what you want to hear.
But as humans, we still crave those discrepancies, those unexpected events that occur.

Perhaps, if AI frees up more of our time, we'll have more opportunities to do things together.
I would rather go hiking or fishing in the mountains with my children.

People enjoy being with others; they watch videos on YouTube but still attend conferences (something we learned from Covid).
Also, humans need a sense of pride in whatever they do, something AI cannot provide.

On the other hand, corporations are driven by financial gain, seeking any avenue that minimizes costs and maximizes revenue.
Humans are seen as a cost, whether in food production, software development, or car sales. 
Companies are already exploring how to eliminate human elements to optimize revenue, as that's where they see the value.
As a customer, I highly value the human experience in many life endeavors.

# The Social Killer

<aside class="quote">
    <em>“AI systems are going to be the new social killer.”</em>
</aside>

AI will not ramble as I do.
We are losing so many capabilities because of cell phones, because of this new ability to eliminate human interaction.
It will be fascinating to see how AI takes this to the next level.

It's always the case that we try to envision new technology in terms of practical use cases for good.
But history has shown that technology, although intended for good, often ends up being used for nefarious purposes.
The reality, measured against history, is unlikely to be good.
The question is: how do we minimize that?

Why is social media so bad?
Perhaps those at the top want us to become addicted to it so they can maintain their positions.

Non-verbal interaction is incredibly important.
You meet a person and learn from the entire experience of being human.

Children learn from their parents, but now they are learning from the internet.
Thus, they start imitating what they see online, which is not beneficial.
In a few years, we are going to see children speaking like an AI.

# Sparks of Hope

<aside class="quote">
    <em>“For the most part of everything I do, I'm not looking for perfection, I'm rather seeking for the experience.”</em> 
</aside>

I would like to end on a positive note.
AI has all the potential to augment the human experience to a level that we have never seen before.
The case of VR headsets, like the recently launched Apple Vision Pro. 

It seems that we are not going to lose our jobs as long as we learn how to use and leverage AI because it's coming and we can't stop it.

    &#169; According to <a href="https://www.amacad.org/sites/default/files/publication/downloads/Daedalus_Sp22_19_Brynjolfsson.pdf">Erik Brynjolfsson</a>, opportunities for augmenting humans are far greater than opportunities to automate existing tasks.

We can make a private tutor that is specifically trained to suit our needs.
In this way, high-quality education can be accessible to everyone.

AI can design beautiful and valid architecture structures, way better than our ugly square buildings.
So, beautiful architecture is going to become possible for way more people that what it is now.

My big hope on AI is to used in politics.
To improve democracy, to make it more fair.
For example, an AI can analyze the individual needs of every citizen and make the best decision, from the neighborhood to country as a whole.

We risks to have less human interation, but maybe we'll have more time.
It's all about choices in our society.
AI is already here, it's not going anywhere, and it's inevitable.
