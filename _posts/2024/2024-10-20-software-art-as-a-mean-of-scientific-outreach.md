Art is everywhere.
It's a universal language that transcends borders, cultures, and sometimes even time.
We use it as a way of expression, to communicate complex ideas with beauty. 
Software is both things: beautiful and complex.
So I believe art is the perfect medium to communicate software concepts to a broader audience.
And during my PhD, I was close to my supervisor, [Benoit Baudry](https://softwarediversity.eu/), who is deeply involved in using software art as a mean of scientific outreach.
In this blog post, I want to share with you some of the insights I've learned from him and how I've applied them to my research.
Also, I'll like to share software art tools, and point out to some of the most influential artists in the field of software art and how they are using it to communicate their ideas.

# History of Generative Art

Learn about open source software environments and practices for generative digital art.
Computer science students dive into the technical challenges of algorithmic art, beyond the utilitarian aspects of software.
Artists and designers dive into open source software and the diversity of techniques it offers for algorithmic art.
I was close the [reth|read](https://rethread.art/) team at KTH during my PhD. 

It has deep roots in the fields of graphics and visual arts.

# Motivations



## Illustrating Complexity



These tools focus on debloating Java dependencies, with DepClean and DepTrim being the specialists in that field.
The mission is simple, yet grand: making Java applications leaner, more efficient, and free of any unnecessary dependencies.

Just like a comic strip artist distills complex emotions into simple drawings, these tools simplify the complicated web of Java dependencies.

This is why you should learn algorithmic art:
- design, develop and run a piece of algorithmic art
- use diverse software environments for algorithmic art 
- use and develop open source software for algorithmic art
- perform algorithmic art for live coding


## Scientific Outreach

Here are some examples of how other researchers have used art to communicate their research:

- [Dance Your Ph.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Your_Ph.D.) is a contest wherein scientists express their research through dance. The purpose of the contest is to educate by explaining complex theories through interpretive dance.
- [Lizzie Burns](https://www.youtube.com/@DrLizzieBurns) uses origami and other forms of tactile art to explain science.
- [My Thesis in Pictures](https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/science-in-pictures/my-phd-thesis-in-pictures/viewer?title_no=828009&episode_no=1&webtoon-platform-redirect=true), by Kunal Deoskal.

Examples in Computer Science:

- [Daniel Shiffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Shiffman)'s [Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/) is a community of enthusiasts learning coding through art. All videos are in his amazing [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain).


> Examples of PhD students in Computer Science translating their research into some for of art are rare.
> However, this field has a rich intersection with art.
> Algorithms and generative art, data visualizations, and creative coding are just a few examples.

One cannot help but notice that comics have a universal appeal.
They resonate with young students, making complex ideas accessible, engaging, and fun.
Through this comic, the technical details of debloating Java applications became more than lines of code; they transformed into characters with personalities and stories.

Art has always been a bridge between the abstract and tangible.
Famous researchers like Einstein used visual imagery, while Carl Sagan turned to eloquent prose to reach out to the public.
This convergence of art and science illuminates the complexity, making the esoteric accessible to anyone with curiosity.

Take Einstein's theory of relativity, for example.
It's a concept that can make even the brightest minds dizzy.
Yet, when visualized as a fabric of space and time, it turns into a story that one can almost touch.

## Creativity in Science

[//]: # (Quote by Carl Sagan)
<aside class="quote">
    <em>“Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were. But without it, we go nowhere.”</em><br> 
    ―  <cite>Carl Sagan</cite> 
</aside>

But why use comics?
Why not stick to the tried and true methods of research papers and lectures?
The answer lies in the heart of creativity.

"Science without creativity is like a tree without branches."
A rigid structure that doesn't allow the mind to wander, to explore, and to connect.

In a world where technology and innovation drive progress, the role of creativity in science cannot be overstated.
It fosters fresh ideas, novel approaches, and pushes the boundaries of what's possible.
By connecting with young minds through comics, we might just inspire the next generation of scientists to think outside the box.

# Tools for generative art

[p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [Processing](https://processing.org/) are two great tools for creative coding:

- https://p5js.org/ is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.
- https://processing.org/ is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology. There are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning and prototyping.
