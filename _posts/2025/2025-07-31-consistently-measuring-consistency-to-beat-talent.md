I've never considered myself particularly talented at anything.
Ever.
Since primary school, there were always other kids performing better than me.
They ran faster, got higher grades, looked better, and so on...

If we had followed the predictions, today I should be a complete loser,[^5] and my talented early peers should be doing pretty well.
But a couple of decades later, I've noticed that only a few of these kids are actually successful today (according to most common success metrics).
I don't consider myself a loser, at all.

Why has this happened?

After some thought, I concluded that the reason is that I've just outworked my popular early fellows with **consistent hard work**.
Nothing else.
Period.

Based on what I've seen, I confidently argue that anybody can outperform their toughest competitors by just being consistent.
No matter how hard it seems, or how good they are.
The question is not "if" but "when."

The problem is that not everybody has what it takes to stay consistent over time.
Because willpower, motivation, and discipline are not enough.
And admittedly, failing constantly (at anything) really sucks.

So, how to achieve this kind of consistency?

It may work differently for you, but for me it's a matter of **consistently measuring my level of consistency**.

Let me explain.

# Consistency Beats Talent

You have probably already heard that consistency is what separates top achievers from the rest of us.
This is actually not that obvious.
Indeed, many years ago, I had serious doubts about it.
The reason is that I heavily overestimated raw talent and luck.

I used to think that it would be impossible for me to learn English on my own without a proper teacher.
I used to think that I'm not smart enough to get a PhD because that is reserved for smart guys with obscure math understanding.
I used to think that I couldn't get in good shape because of my genes.
I was wrong.
These were actually excuses I made up in order to escape from the hard work.

Over and over, I've witnessed that although talent only gives a head start, it is consistency that determines how far you can go.

Even the most talented person in the room won't win if they only show up occasionally.
But those who show up over a long period of time, even with average skills, will eventually surpass the talented but flaky ones.[^4]

> “The only thing that I see that is distinctly different about me is I'm not afraid to die on a treadmill. I will not be out-worked, period. You might have more talent than me, you might be smarter than me, you might be sexier than me, you might be all of those things you got it on me in nine categories. But if we get on the treadmill together, there's two things: You're getting off first, or I'm going to die. It's really that simple, right? You're not going to out-work me. It's such a simple, basic concept. The guy who is willing to hustle the most is going to be the guy that just gets that loose ball. The majority of people who aren't getting the places they want or aren't achieving the things that they want in this business is strictly based on hustle. It's strictly based on being out-worked; it's strictly based on missing crucial opportunities. I say all the time if you stay ready, you ain't gotta get ready.”

To achieve anything meaningful in life, whether it's getting in the top 1% at something, building a career, or improving health, consistency is the real differentiator.
It's all about not being outworked.
But as with anything else that we consider valuable, staying consistent takes significant time and effort to get.

# Consistency is Hard to Achieve

If I told you that you needed to write [69 blog posts over 9 years](../blog/all-posts.html) **before** getting [one of them](../blog/i-am-switching-to-python-and-actually-liking-it.html) [at the top of Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44579717), would you still write blog posts with that goal in mind?[^2]

If I told you that you needed to learn how to do research yourself, write your own research papers, and get some of them published **before** getting a PhD student offer [that would change your life](../blog/seven-reasons-to-go-for-a-phd-in-computer-science.html), would you still try to become a PhD student?

Or what if you have to make 100 YouTube videos until you get your first 1000 subscribers, would you still try to become a successful YouTuber?[^1]

That's a lot of effort, and most people wouldn’t do the work.

> “Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.”

The fact that we have so many distractions and information flows nowadays makes consistent people very rare.
Admittedly, it's very easy to get distracted by all kinds of shiny opportunities (just ask memecoin investors).
You need to become [indistractable](https://a.co/d/5F3bVnM).

Modern society is making us addicted to easy gratification; when we don't get it immediately, we tend to give up.
Most people will never have the consistency to overcome tedious repetition for that long.[^3]

If you can learn to cultivate consistency in your work, you’ll eventually beat most people.
No matter how much talent, luck, or skill they have, just by being consistent.
But you need to put in the effort.

All the time you’ll spend working hard and failing will make you think you’re a loser.
You’ll feel like a nobody who sucks and isn’t good for anything and should just quit because you’ll never be good enough.
This is how I feel most of the time.
But I'm conscious of this feeling.

Consistency, at its core, is a lonely pursuit.
Commitment to something long-term could be lonely, boring, and tedious.
If you ask successful entrepreneurs, they were probably working on their business for years before they got any traction.

To sustain consistency, what I do is trick my brain into it.

# Consistency Needs to Be Measured

I came up with a system to measure how consistent I'm being over time.

What I do:

1. Set ~~easy~~ realistic goals.
2. Track my progress (automatically).
3. Reward myself when hitting milestones.

## Setting Realistic Goals

Every year, I set a few goals that I want to achieve.
I try to keep them small (no more than 5), so I can actually achieve them.

{% linkedin cesarsotovalero_just-before-starting-every-new-year-i-do-activity-7280462841755631617-zaoS %}

Once I set my goals, I lower the barrier to starting to the minimum.
Making daily targets so small I can't say no.
For that, I break down complex tasks into something easy to measure.

For example, if you want to read a book, you can set a goal of reading just 10 pages a day.
If you read 10 pages a day, you'll have read 3,650 pages in a year, which is about 10 books.
If you want to write a blog post, you can set a goal of writing just 200 words a day.
If you write 200 words a day, you'll have written 73,000 words in a year, which is enough for a full-length book.

The key isn't doing a lot in one sitting, but making some little progress every single day.

## Tracking the Progress

I don't use a habit tracker, spreadsheet, or calendar.
Instead, I rely on **public exposure** of my work and automation systems that keep track of my progress.

For example, I've [automated](https://github.com/cesarsotovalero/cesarsotovalero.github.io/blob/f5cea42089dad8df514aed0a305dfa98b5dab3f8/.github/workflows/compile-resume-to-pdf.yml) the way I build [my resume](https://www.cesarsotovalero.net/files/CV/cesar-resume.pdf) using $$ \LaTeX $$ and GitHub actions.
For that, I [created Python scripts](https://github.com/cesarsotovalero/cesarsotovalero.github.io/tree/master/scripts) that scrape my number of subscribers on YouTube, the number of followers on LinkedIn, the number of citations on Google Scholar, etc.
I even keep track of [the timings](../races.html) for the races I run.

This allows me to see my progress over time, and it also gives me a sense of accountability.
At the end of each week or month, I look at my numbers to see if I hit my targets, and where I fell short.

## Celebrating Achievements

Celebrating is important.
Every time I hit a milestone, I reward myself by doing something I enjoy but know I shouldn't do too often (like spending money in a restaurant or buying a new gadget).

> "Happiness to me is what I feel when consistently achieving my goals."

My PhD supervisor was very serious about celebrating successes.
Every time we submitted a new paper, we always celebrated the submission.
Yes, we celebrated not the acceptance, but **the submission**.
This is because he knew that the process of writing a paper is long and tedious.
He wanted to acknowledge the effort it took us to get to that point.

So, don't wait for the big wins, the numbers to celebrate, celebrate when it's done.

# Final Thoughts

Consistency is the ultimate differentiator.
But only a few people have it because we all have finite energy, time, and willpower.
If you want to beat talent, luck, or even your own past self, start measuring it.
Put numbers on it.
Because what gets measured gets improved.
Rely on systems, and keep in mind that everything is difficult before it becomes easy.
Reward yourself for the small wins, and don't wait for the big ones.
Try to surround yourself with consistent people.
And no matter what, just don't give up.

[^3]: I have a friend who is a professional athlete, and he told me that the hardest part of his job is to stay consistent over time. He has to train every day, even when he doesn't feel like it, and that takes a lot of mental strength.

[^4]: The idea that simple repetition will notj bring you very far doesn’t hold true today, AI solves the problem of lacking smart guidance and deliberate learning. Anyone can have the right guidance to learn the right things.
