I remember, a long time ago, when I was 10, I had only a few old books at home.
The new ones either weren‚Äôt available or were too expensive for my narrow pocket.
If I wanted to read good stuff back then, I had to walk to the local library and read them there.

Ten years later, in my 20s, I observed that university professors had read a lot of books.
They were respected for the sheer amount of knowledge they had accumulated over a lifetime.
We valued them because their skills and expertise were scarce.

Now, in my 30s, reading books is not as trendy as before, and knowledge is available from anywhere.
Getting access to information is cheaper than ever, and even the latest scientific advances move at lightspeed.
A curious 10-year-old today can access cutting-edge tools and learn from the latest research papers, right from home!

More remarkably, AI has drastically changed the way we value knowledge in the last few years.
Everyone can now prompt an AI assistant (like ChatGPT) for free and get almost instant answers to practically any imaginable question.
I believe AI represents an optimization shift in the way we search for human knowledge.
The impact could be even more than what the Google search engine did in the early days of the internet.

AI has made answers abundant and general knowledge intuitively accessible.
However, current AI models still struggle to figure out how to apply, synthesize, and adapt existing knowledge to create something genuinely new.
This limitation is a consequence of the way current language models operate.

With the rise of more advanced reasoning models, the ability to formulate the right questions to drive AI in the right direction is a skill we need to incorporate into our everyday lives.
AI has shifted our focus from trying to find answers to thinking about *what* and *how* to formulate the right questions.

I‚Äôd argue that as the value of getting answers goes down, the value of formulating new questions that drive actual action should go up.
So, coming up with original and relevant questions represents a real competitive edge.

What‚Äôs more, I believe that the perceived value of those who have mastered the ‚Äúart of asking questions‚Äù will increase accordingly.
Just look at the rise of professions that rely heavily on questioning skills such as podcasters and interviewers.
These guys have mastered the ability to ask good questions and extract value for their audience.

Day by day, I'm doing a conscious effort at becoming better at the art of asking questions.
This post is about techniques, patterns and anti-patterns I‚Äôve learned over time from top questioners.
It covers real world examples and best practices targeting both humans and AI alike.

üëâ Check out my compilation of [Job Interview Questions](TODO).

# When to Ask Questions?

Short answer: every time you can!

Back in the day, asking frequent questions was considered an annoying practice in many cases.
Why?
I'd argue that our inherent human laziness had something to do with it.
Leaving a question hanging meant somebody had to squeeze their brain to find an answer (i.e., to work).
Otherwise, an uncomfortable void of uncertainty threatened to emerge.

This is no longer the case.

AI has completely removed the fear of ‚Äúfeeling stupid‚Äù for both sides: the asker and the responder.
The more we use AI, the more comfortable we become with the idea of questioning everything.
In meetings or events, asking is a signal of attention, and in an era where AI can respond fast, it also signals the ability to challenge the *status quo* and express a personal opinion.

The more questions you ask, the better prepared you will be for whatever is coming next.

# Techniques

Good questions have purpose and "make sense" in general.[^1]
They are unambiguous, give just enough context, and set limits.

Scope is reduced so that answer feel smaller.
The question itself must strip away everything irrelevant.
As a rule of thumb, if a the question doesn‚Äôt make any difference to the argument, it needs to be sharpened.

There are three techniques to improve question formulation:

- Aim, scope, and payoff (ASP)
- Clarity, context, and constraints (3C)
- Falsifiability and measurability (FM)

## Aim, Scope, Payoff

Without aim you wander.
Without scope you boil the ocean.
Without payoff you can‚Äôt act.
A good question changes what happens in the next 10 minutes.

So, the core idea is to state what you‚Äôre trying to achieve (aim), how far you‚Äôll look (scope), and what you‚Äôll do with the answer (payoff).

| Element    | Description                                            | Template                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Aim**    | What you want to achieve.                              | ‚ÄúWe want to \_\_.‚Äù                             |
| **Scope**  | Boundaries of your inquiry (data, time, users, tools). | ‚ÄúWithin \_\_ (data/time/users/tools).‚Äù         |
| **Payoff** | What you‚Äôll do with the answer.                        | ‚ÄúSo we can \_\_ (decision/action/experiment).‚Äù |

Examples:

| ‚ùå Before (Vague)                             | ‚úÖ After (ASP Applied)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Product:** ‚ÄúHow do we improve onboarding?‚Äù | **Aim:** Increase week-1 activation. **Scope:** Mobile iOS, signup flow only. **Payoff:** Decide which of 3 changes to A/B test.<br>**Question:** ‚ÄúWhat single change in the iOS signup flow would most increase week-1 activation, and which 3 options should we A/B test first?‚Äù |
| **Research:** ‚ÄúIs our model good?‚Äù           | **Aim:** Decide to ship or retrain. **Scope:** Fraud model v2, last 30 days. **Payoff:** Go/no-go.<br>**Question:** ‚ÄúGiven the last 30 days, does fraud-v2 beat fraud-v1 on precision\@top1% by ‚â•2pp at equal recall, so we ship or retrain?‚Äù                                      |
| **Personal:** ‚ÄúHow can I get healthier?‚Äù     | **Aim:** Improve sleep. **Scope:** Next 14 days, bedtime routine only. **Payoff:** Adopt one habit.<br>**Question:** ‚ÄúWhich single bedtime habit should I try for 14 days to raise average sleep by 30 minutes?‚Äù                                                                   |

## Clarity, Context, Constraints

Clarity prevents misreads, context prevents wheel-reinvention, constraints prevent infinite ‚Äúit depends.‚Äù

The core idea of this principle is to make the question unambiguous, include the background that matters, and set limits that force trade-offs.

| Element         | Description                                                           | Example                                                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clarity         | Define terms, units, and success. Prefer nouns/verbs over adjectives. | ‚ÄúWrite-heavy workload (\~5k writes/sec), 99.9% latency <10ms‚Äù |
| Context         | Minimum viable backstory: objective, prior attempts, relevant data.   | ‚ÄúChurn up 3% in SMB last quarter‚Äù                             |
| Constraints     | Time, budget, tools, risk tolerance, guardrails.                      | ‚ÄúEU-only, managed service, must decide by Friday‚Äù             |

Quick rewrites:

| ‚ùå Before                    | ‚úÖ After                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best database?‚Äù | ‚ÄúFor a write-heavy workload (\~5k writes/sec), 99.9% latency <10ms, EU-only, managed service, what database should we evaluate first and why?‚Äù |
| ‚ÄúHow should I learn LLMs?‚Äù  | ‚ÄúWith 5 hours/week for 6 weeks and access to GCP, what learning plan gets me from zero to fine-tuning a small model on our support tickets?‚Äù  |

## Falsifiability and Measurability

Decisions stick when they survive an attempt to disprove them.
Measurement turns opinion into feedback.
The core idea is to phrase questions so answers can be tested. If it can‚Äôt be wrong, it can‚Äôt be right.

| Pattern                 | Description                                   | Example                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hypothesis form     | State belief, expected outcome, magnitude, audience, and timeframe. | ‚ÄúWe believe shortening the signup form from 7 to 4 fields will raise iOS activation by 3‚Äì5% for new users within 14 days.‚Äù |
| Acceptance criteria | Define clear pass/fail metrics.                                     | ‚ÄúShip if precision\@top1% ‚â• 0.92 with recall ‚â• 0.55 on June data.‚Äù                                                         |
| Disconfirmers first | Identify what would prove the belief false.                         | ‚ÄúIf activation does not increase by ‚â•1% after 7 days with 95% CI, abandon the change.‚Äù                                     |

Measurability checklist:

| Requirement               | Description                        |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Named metric              | Not vibes, actual measurable value. |
| Baseline & delta          | Current value and target change.   |
| Time window & sample size | Duration and amount of data.       |
| Data source & method      | How you‚Äôll calculate the metric.   |
| Decision rule             | Go/stop/iterate conditions.        |

# Patterns

Reusable question patterns help you think more clearly, spot blind spots, and get better answers faster.

Here are eight you can borrow and use right away.

1. First-principles (‚ÄúWhat are the primitives?‚Äù)

Strip away jargon and complexity until you get to the most basic truths. From there, rebuild your understanding.
This works because reality is easier to reason about than opinions.

2. Inversion (‚ÄúHow could this fail?‚Äù)

Instead of only asking how to succeed, flip the question and look for ways it could go wrong.
Anticipating failure is often the fastest way to avoid it.

3. Disconfirming evidence (‚ÄúWhat would prove me wrong?‚Äù)

Ask what would make your current belief false.
This keeps you from cherry-picking facts that only confirm your view.

4. Assumption audit (‚ÄúWhat am I taking for granted?‚Äù)

List the things you believe are true without checking.
Questioning assumptions often reveals the weakest part of your thinking.

5. Constraint lens (‚ÄúWhat if we had half the time/budget?‚Äù)

Imagine having fewer resources.
Constraints force creativity, sharpen priorities, and surface shortcuts you might have missed.

6. Comparative calibration (‚ÄúCompared to what?‚Äù)

Numbers and claims mean little without context.
Always anchor them to a baseline, a competitor, or a past result.

7. Decomposition (‚ÄúCan we split this into 3 parts?‚Äù)

Break a big problem into smaller, more manageable chunks.
Solving each piece separately is often faster and less overwhelming.

8. Time travel (pre-mortem/post-mortem)

Jump forward in time. In a pre-mortem, imagine the project has failed and ask why.
In a post-mortem, imagine it has succeeded and trace back the steps that led there.

> Use questions to turn meetings into decisions, incidents into root causes, and hunches into hypotheses.

# Anti-Patterns

Some questions don‚Äôt just fail to help but actually backfire.
They actively distort the truth or shut down useful discussion.

Here are three common traps to avoid:

1. Loaded and leading questions

These questions sneak in assumptions or push the respondent toward a certain answer.
For example, ‚ÄúWhy is our onboarding so bad?‚Äù assumes it *is* bad. Instead, ask neutrally: ‚ÄúHow does our onboarding compare to expectations?‚Äù

2. Double-barreled and vague scope

Two questions in one confuse people and muddy the answer.
 ‚ÄúHow do we improve onboarding and reduce churn?‚Äù is really two separate discussions.
 Similarly, asking with no clear scope, like ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best database?‚Äù, leads to endless ‚Äúit depends.‚Äù Split them and define the boundaries.

3. Why-blame vs. how-fix framing

Asking ‚ÄúWho messed this up?‚Äù shifts focus to defending reputations instead of solving problems.
‚ÄúHow can we prevent this next time?‚Äù keeps the discussion forward-looking and solution-oriented.

4. Scope creep

Two questions in one confuse people and muddy the answer.
‚ÄúHow do we improve onboarding and reduce churn?‚Äù is really two separate discussions.
 Similarly, asking with no clear scope (like ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best database?‚Äù) leads to endless ‚Äúit depends.‚Äù Split them and define the boundaries.

[^2]: Note that in the case of humans, we tolerate less quality answers. In many cases, the exact answer is not as important as the method through which you came to that answer.

# Non Technical

- What are your questions for me?
- What question should I ask that will make me want to hire you? -> I ask this at the end of the interview.
- What have you learned in the last six months?
- In what way do people underestimate you?
- I love "teach me about a time you had to learn something in a short time span"
- What kind of person are you?
- What important truth do very few people agree with you on?
- "Why shouldn't I hire you?" -> Tests candidates' Theory of Mind capability, i.e., can the candidates take someone else's perspective, and offers the opportunity for deep, introspective answers.
- "What is the conventional wisdom in [technical field XYZ] that you most strongly disagree with and why?" -> Tests candidates' comprehension of status quo of the technical field and their ability to critically reflect on the status quo.
- If you could replace the office coffee machine with any other dispenser, what would it be?
- If married / in a relationship - what about your partner made you choose them? -> The answer will share what the interviewee values in a person and often times what the interviewee‚Äôs self-perceived weaknesses are.
- What‚Äôs your favourite fruit. Then ask ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù. -> It shows you how the interviewee makes an argument around something subjective. I‚Äôve found this can be a lens into how one thinks and communicates when things are ambiguous.
- ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your superpower?
- What is the next thing you want to learn?
- What is the hardest problem (each in private life and business context) and share with me in detail on how you conquered it (even when you ‚Äúfailed‚Äù)?
- 'Who from your previous company would you bring with you to maximize our chances of success?' -> Found it to be a great way to (1) uncover high-quality referrals, but also (2) a subtle way to surface blind spots or assumptions a candidate may have about their role

- Tell me about something you changed your mind on recently. (shows intellectual humility)
- What would your least favorite coworker say about you? (uncovers self-awareness)
- What‚Äôs the best part of your job?
- As a leader, how do you know if you're being effective or having impact? Based on that - how do you prioritize your time?
- As you come in to this position - what are the roles, skills or personalities you need to ensure is around you or in your team for you to succeed?
- How do you build relationships and trust with people in your team ?
- If everything goes right in your current company over the next five years, where do you end up? How will you have got there?
- What's the boldest decision you've made in the past year that ultimately involved a 'leap of faith' in the absence of good data?
- What kind of work makes you lose track of time?

- Which constructive feedback have you received more than once? Did you incorporate change with regard to it or not? Why? (Answer so much more than this specific question)
- Tell me about a mistake you made and how it affected the broader organization or your team? (Same with this one, especially if the person blames circumstances/team and can't take responsibility for own mistakes)
- Other than that, digging into "how do you know that?" "how did you measure that?" "what was the outcome?" gives me a sense of if a person understands the bigger picture of actions or sees themselves as a "coder" alone.
- Pick an area you know really well. Take 5 minutes to prepare and then teach me everything I should know about it.
- Whats important in your life? Why?
- What does resilience look like for you?
- What is the worst question I could ask you and why

"Could you walk me through your most important life and career choices, that made you end up here - and why you took them?" -> A good answer here could signal high intentionality, self-reflection, and personal drive. This also indicates if the person can handle life challenges and changes (e.g. kids, sickness, job loss, etc.)

teach me about your favorite topic in the world

If you look back at your time at [X company]/ working on [X project], what would you have done differently?
What did you learn at [X company] /working on [X project] that you didn't know before?

If you could go back in time and give yourself one piece of advice, what would it be?

1. 'What's the most difficult feedback you've received and how did it change you?' - They should be able to say a concrete example which will show that they aren't perfect and are coachable.
2. Who was the best manager you ever had? Why? Worst manager and why? - This will give insight into how they like to be managed and/or how they will manage others. It will also bring red flags to the table in a heartbeat "My old manager was an idiot", yada yada

"What views do you hold almost irrationally?"
"What's an common truth in your industry/function that you strongly disagree with"?

"What have you changed your mind on recently?"
