  Consistency is often underestimated compared to raw talent or even luck. But if you want to achieve anything meaningful—whether it's mastering a skill, building a career, or improving your health—consistency is the real differentiator.

## Why Consistency Beats Talent

Talent gives you a head start, but consistency determines how far you go. The most talented person in the room won't win if they only show up occasionally. The person who shows up every day, even with average skills, will eventually surpass the talented but inconsistent.

## Put Numbers on Consistency

If you want to improve your consistency, you need to measure it. Here are some ways to put numbers on your consistency:

- **Track your streaks:** How many days in a row did you practice, write, code, or exercise?
- **Count your reps:** How many times did you complete your target activity this week or month?
- **Set minimums:** What is the smallest unit of progress you can commit to every day? (e.g., write 100 words, do 10 pushups, read 1 page)
- **Review your stats:** At the end of each week or month, look at your numbers. Did you hit your targets? Where did you fall short?

## Example: The Power of Small, Consistent Actions

Suppose you want to write a book. If you write just 200 words a day, you'll have 73,000 words in a year—enough for a full-length novel. The key isn't writing a lot in one sitting, but writing a little every day.

## How to Build Consistency

1. **Make it easy:** Lower the barrier to starting. Make your daily target so small you can't say no.
2. **Track your progress:** Use a habit tracker, spreadsheet, or calendar.
3. **Forgive yourself:** If you miss a day, don't quit. Start again the next day.
4. **Celebrate streaks:** Reward yourself for hitting milestones.

## Final Thoughts

Consistency is a superpower. If you want to beat talent, luck, or even your own past self, start measuring your consistency. Put numbers on it. What gets measured gets improved.
