Why communicating is important.

Communication at job interviews.

The art of asking questions and why it's important.

Most conventional interview questions are boring (e.g. some of the best interview questions focus on a candidate's past experiences, problem-solving skills, and future goals. Examples include, "Tell me about a time you failed and what you learned," "Describe a situation where you had to adjust your priorities," or "Where do you see yourself in five years?" These questions help assess a candidate's self-awareness, adaptability, and career aspirations)

Technical vs. Behavioral questions.

Why you should read this.

I post the question, and the rationale behind it later on.

> I like asking things somewhat indirectly to avoid bias or answers to please an interviewer.


> More important than what you ask is often the quality of questions a candidate asks YOU. It gives you a sense of their strategic thinking capabilities, of work ethic (have they done their homework?) but perhaps more importantly - of their empathy and ability to connect and learn from others. Not to mention the size of their ego…

# Technical

- How easy or difficult it is to change a single field's type, add/remove fields at the platform level? Would clients break? Trying to determine the cascading effects it brings at Platform to Client levels.

Basics: How does the web work?
Taste: Whats your favourite software and why?
Complexity: explain in detail your opus magnum as if I’m a business person then a techs. Then I Go deep
Vision: what does the future look like for <their tech>

What are you afraid of?

My most proud answer was to the interview question ‘why do wheetabix come in packets of 12 or 24’
I was able to say ‘it’s customer centric because whether a consumer likes to have 1,2,3, or 4 wheetabix, they finish the packet cleanly.


You type <YOur company name> into the address bar of your browser and press enter. What happens next?

I also once asked a candidate to explain quantum entanglement in as few words as possible… he put two cups on the table and said ‘you move this, this moves’ as he twisted the cups… technically.. three words… beautiful, he was hired.

What's the thing you've done in your career or life that was the toughest to make happen, that you felt like giving up on, but you made it happen and now it's up there with your proudest accomplishments? Tell me the story

What's your best prompt and why?

"What is the last thing you learned that was not related to your work?"
Looking for curious people that want to grow.


Do you have a favorite model or a tool that you feel is underrated ?



# Non Technical

What are your questions for me?


What question should I ask that will make me want to hire you? -> I ask this at the end of the interview.

- ”What have you learned in the last six months?”



In what way do people underestimate you?

i love "teach me about a time you had to learn something in a short time span"


- What kind of person are you?

- What important truth do very few people agree with you on?

- "Why shouldn't I hire you?" -> Tests candidates' Theory of Mind capability, i.e., can the candidates take someone else's perspective, and offers the opportunity for deep, introspective answers.

- "What is the conventional wisdom in [technical field XYZ] that you most strongly disagree with and why?" -> Tests candidates' comprehension of status quo of the technical field and their ability to critically reflect on the status quo.

- If you could replace the office coffee machine with any other dispenser, what would it be?


- If married / in a relationship - what about your partner made you choose them? -> The answer will share what the interviewee values in a person and often times what the interviewee’s self-perceived weaknesses are.

- What’s your favourite fruit. Then ask “why?”.  -> It shows you how the interviewee makes an argument around something subjective. I’ve found this can be a lens into how one thinks and communicates when things are ambiguous.

- “What’s your superpower?
- What is the next thing you want to learn?
- What is the hardest problem (each in private life and business context) and share with me in detail on how you conquered it (even when you “failed”)?
- 'Who from your previous company would you bring with you to maximize our chances of success?' -> Found it to be a great way to (1) uncover high-quality referrals, but also (2) a subtle way to surface blind spots or assumptions a candidate may have about their role
- What do people get wrong about you on first impressions? What would they say on day 1 and after 6 months?


- Why should we hire you?
- What makes you suitable for this role?
- Why are you still sitting here after i asked you those questions?



- What energizes you at work? (reveals intrinsic motivation)
- Tell me about something you changed your mind on recently. (shows intellectual humility)
- What would your least favorite coworker say about you? (uncovers self-awareness)

- What’s the best part of your job?

- As a leader, how do you know if you're being effective or having impact? Based on that - how do you prioritize your time?
- As you come in to this position - what are the roles, skills or personalities you need to ensure is around you or in your team for you to succeed?


- How do you build relationships and trust with people in your team ?

If everything goes right in your current company over the next five years, where do you end up? How will you have got there?

What's the boldest decision you've made in the past year that ultimately involved a 'leap of faith' in the absence of good data?


What kind of work makes you lose track of time?



What question would you have wanted me to ask?

Why are you here today?



1) If I were to complement you with another team mate, what personality traits or skillset would be complementary to yours? (A non-obvious way of asking, what are your weaknesses).

2) Which constructive feedback have you received more than once? Did you incorporate change with regard to it or not? Why? (Answer so much more than this specific question)

3) Tell me about a mistake you made and how it affected the broader organization or your team? (Same with this one, especially if the person blames circumstances/team and can't take responsibility for own mistakes)

Other than that, digging into "how do you know that?" "how did you measure that?" "what was the outcome?" gives me a sense of if a person understands the bigger picture of actions or sees themselves as a "coder" alone.

Pick an area you know really well. Take 5 minutes to prepare and then teach me everything I should know about it.

Whats important in your life? Why?

What does resilience look like for you?


what is the worst question I could ask you and why


"Could you walk me through your most important life and career choices, that made you end up here - and why you took them?" -> A good answer here could signal high intentionality, self-reflection, and personal drive. This also indicates if the person can handle life challenges and changes (e.g. kids, sickness, job loss, etc.)


teach me about your favorite topic in the world



If you look back at your time at [X company]/ working on [X project], what would you have done differently?
What did you learn at [X company] /working on [X project] that you didn't know before?



If you could go back in time and give yourself one piece of advice, what would it be?




1. 'What's the most difficult feedback you've received and how did it change you?' - They should be able to say a concrete example which will show that they aren't perfect and are coachable.
2. Who was the best manager you ever had? Why? Worst manager and why? - This will give insight into how they like to be managed and/or how they will manage others. It will also bring red flags to the table in a heartbeat "My old manager was an idiot", yada yada


"What views do you hold almost irrationally?"
"What's an common truth in your industry/function that you strongly disagree with"?

"What have you changed your mind on recently?"

What’s the hardest professional decision you’ve ever had to make?

How do you contribute to a positive and inclusive work environment, especially when the team is under pressure?

Tell me about one professional achievement that you’re particularly proud of.

tell me sth you believe to be true, but that most people would disagree with


What is the hardest problem, both professional and personal you solved, why and how?

What gives you energy?
