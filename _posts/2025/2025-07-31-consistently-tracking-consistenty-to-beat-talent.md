I've never considered myself particularly talented at anything.
Ever.

Since primary school, there where always other kids performing better than me.
They ran faster, got higher grades, looked better, and so on...

If we had follow the predictions, today I should be a looser (or something worse).
My talented early peers should be doing pretty well.
But a couple of decades after, I've noticed that only a few of these kids are actually successful (according to common success metrics).
And I don't consider myself a looser, at all.

Why has this happened?

After some thoughts, I concluded that the reason is that I've just outworked my popular early fellows with **consistent hard work**.
Nothing else.
Period.

Based on what I've seen, I confidently argue that anybody can outperform their toughest competitors by just being consistent.
No matter how hard it seems, or how good they are.
The question is not **if** but **when**.

The problem is that not anybody have what it takes to stay consistet over time.
Because willpower, motivation, and discipline are not enough.
And admittedly, failing constantly (at anything) really sucks.

So, how to achieve consistency?

It may work different for you, but for me it's a matter of **consistenly tracking my consistency**.

Let me explain.

# Consistency Beats Talent

You have probably already heard that consistency is what separates top achievers from the rest.
But it's actually not that obvious.
Indeed, many years ago, I had serious doubts about it.
I over-estimated raw talent and luck.

I used to think that it would be impossible for me to learn English on my own without a proper teacher.
I used to think that I'm not smart enough to get a PhD because that is reserved for smart guys with obscure math understanding.
I used to think that I couldn't get in good shape because of my genes.
I was wrong.
These were actually excuses I made up in order to escape from the hard work.

Over and over, I've seen that although talent only gives a head start, but consistency is what determines how far you can go.
Even the most talented person in the room won't win if they only show up occasionally.
But those who shows up every day, even with average skills, will eventually surpass the talented but inconsistent.

> “The only thing that I see that is distinctly different about me is I'm not afraid to die on a treadmill. I will not be out-worked, period. You might have more talent than me, you might be smarter than me, you might be sexier than me, you might be all of those things you got it on me in nine categories. But if we get on the treadmill together, there's two things: You're getting off first, or I'm going to die. It's really that simple, right? You're not going to out-work me. It's such a simple, basic concept. The guy who is willing to hustle the most is going to be the guy that just gets that loose ball. The majority of people who aren't getting the places they want or aren't achieving the things that they want in this business is strictly based on hustle. It's strictly based on being out-worked; it's strictly based on missing crucial opportunities. I say all the time if you stay ready, you ain't gotta get ready.”

Let me said it again.
To achieve anything meaningful, whether it's mastering a skill, building a career, or improving  health, consistency is the real differentiator.

As with anything else that we consider valuable, the skill of staying consist takes time and effort to master.

# Consistency is Hard to Achieve

If I told you that you needed to write [69 blog posts over 9 years](https://www.cesarsotovalero.net/blog/all-posts.html) before [one of them](https://www.cesarsotovalero.net/blog/i-am-switching-to-python-and-actually-liking-it.html) getting [at the top of Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44579717), would you still write post with that goal in mind?
How about that you needed to write your own research papers and get some of them published before you get PhD students offers that would change your life?
Or what if you have to make 100 YouTube videos until you get your fist 100 subscribers?
That's just too much, and most people wouldn’t do the work.

The fact that we have so much distractions and information flows nowadays makes consistent people very rare.
It's easy to get distracted by new things and opportunities.
I see this as an opportunity.
Most people will never have the consistency to overcome the tedious repetition that long.
Modern society society is making us addict to easy gratification, when we don't get it inmediately, we tend to give up.

If you can learn to cultivate consistency in your work, you’ll eventually beat most people.
No matter how talent, luck, or skill they have, just by being consistent.
But you need to put in the effort.

Consistency will make you feel like a loser.
All the time you’ll spend working hard and failing will make you think you’re a loser.
You’ll feel like a nobody who sucks and isn’t good for anything and should just quit because you’ll never be good enough.
At least, that’s how I feel.

At its core, practice is a lonely pursuit.
Commitment to something long-term could lonely, boring, and tedious.
It often is.

# Consistentcy Should be Measured

> Break down complex task in something you can measure.

> Everything is difficult before it becomes easy.

1. **Make it easy:** Lower the barrier to starting. Make your daily target so small you can't say no.
2. **Track your progress:** Use a habit tracker, spreadsheet, or calendar.
3. **Forgive yourself:** If you miss a day, don't quit. Start again the next day.
4. **Celebrate streaks:** Reward yourself for hitting milestones.

> Surround yourself with consistent people.

> I’d much rather have a four hour intense concentrated work session than either hours that’re being forced out of me.

> Today, AI solves the problem of lacking smar guidance and deliberate learning (the idea that simple repetition will not bring you very far).

If you want to improve your consistency, you need to measure it. Here are some ways to put numbers on your consistency:

- **Track your streaks:** How many days in a row did you practice, write, code, or exercise?
- **Count your reps:** How many times did you complete your target activity this week or month?
- **Set minimums:** What is the smallest unit of progress you can commit to every day? (e.g., write 100 words, do 10 pushups, read 1 page)
- **Review your stats:** At the end of each week or month, look at your numbers. Did you hit your targets? Where did you fall short?

Small, consistent actions are important.
Suppose you want to write a book.
If you write just 200 words a day, you'll have 73,000 words in a year, enough for a full-length novel.
The key isn't writing a lot in one sitting, but writing a little every day.

# Final Thoughts

Consistency is a superpower.
If you want to beat talent, luck, or even your own past self, start measuring your consistency.
Put numbers on it. What gets measured gets improved.

Happiness to me is what I feel when consistently achieving my goals.
