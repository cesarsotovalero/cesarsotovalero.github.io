I've never considered myself particularly talented at anything.
Ever.

Since primary school, there where always other kids performing better than me.
They ran faster, got higher grades, looked better, and so on...

If we had follow the predictions, today I should be a loser (or something worse, like watching [Love Is Blind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Is_Blind_(TV_series)) on Netflix).
My talented early peers should be doing pretty well.
But a couple of decades after, I've noticed that only a few of these kids are actually successful (according to common success metrics).
And I don't consider myself a looser, at all.

Why has this happened?

After some thoughts, I concluded that the reason is that I've just outworked my popular early fellows with **consistent hard work**.
Nothing else.
Period.

Based on what I've seen, I confidently argue that anybody can outperform their toughest competitors by just being consistent.
No matter how hard it seems, or how good they are.
The question is not **if** but **when**.

The problem is that not anybody have what it takes to stay consistet over time.
Because willpower, motivation, and discipline are not enough.
And admittedly, failing constantly (at anything) really sucks.

So, how to achieve this kind of consistency?

It may work different for you, but for me it's a matter of **consistently tracking my consistency**.

Let me explain.

# Consistency Beats Talent

You have probably already heard that consistency is what separates top achievers from the rest of us.
This is actually not that obvious.
Indeed, many years ago, I had serious doubts about it.
The reason is that I heavily over-estimated raw talent and luck.

I used to think that it would be impossible for me to learn English on my own without a proper teacher.
I used to think that I'm not smart enough to get a PhD because that is reserved for smart guys with obscure math understanding.
I used to think that I couldn't get in good shape because of my genes.
I was wrong.
These were actually excuses I made up in order to escape from the hard work.

Over and over, I've withnessed that although talent only gives a head start, but is consistency what determines how far you can go.

Even the most talented person in the room won't win if they only show up occasionally.
But those who shows up during a long period of thmie, even with average skills, will eventually surpass the talented but flaky ones.[^4]

> “The only thing that I see that is distinctly different about me is I'm not afraid to die on a treadmill. I will not be out-worked, period. You might have more talent than me, you might be smarter than me, you might be sexier than me, you might be all of those things you got it on me in nine categories. But if we get on the treadmill together, there's two things: You're getting off first, or I'm going to die. It's really that simple, right? You're not going to out-work me. It's such a simple, basic concept. The guy who is willing to hustle the most is going to be the guy that just gets that loose ball. The majority of people who aren't getting the places they want or aren't achieving the things that they want in this business is strictly based on hustle. It's strictly based on being out-worked; it's strictly based on missing crucial opportunities. I say all the time if you stay ready, you ain't gotta get ready.”

To achieve anything meaningful in life, whether it's getting in the top 1% at something, building a career, or improving health, consistency is the real differentiator.
It's all about not being out-worked.
But as with anything else that we consider valuable, staying consistent takes significant time and effort to get.

# Consistency is Hard to Achieve

If I told you that you needed to write [69 blog posts over 9 years](https://www.cesarsotovalero.net/blog/all-posts.html) **before** getting [one of them](https://www.cesarsotovalero.net/blog/i-am-switching-to-python-and-actually-liking-it.html) [at the top of Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44579717), would you still write blog posts with that goal in mind?[^2]

If I told you that you needed to learn how to do research yourself, write your own research papers, and get some of them published **before** getting a PhD student offer [that would change your life](https://www.cesarsotovalero.net/blog/seven-reasons-to-go-for-a-phd-in-computer-science.html), would you still try to become a PhD student?

Or what if you have to make 100 YouTube videos until you get your fist 1000 subscribers, would you still try to become a successful YouTuber?[^1]

That's a lot of effort, and most people wouldn’t do the work.

> “Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.”

The fact that we have so many distractions and information flows nowadays makes consistent people very rare.
Admittedly, it's very easy to get distracted by all kind of shiny opportunities (just ask memecoin investors).
You need to become [indistractable](https://a.co/d/5F3bVnM).

Modern society society is making us addict to easy gratification, when we don't get it inmediately, we tend to give up.
Most people will never have the consistency to overcome the tedious repetition that long.[^3]

If you can learn to cultivate consistency in your work, you’ll eventually beat most people.
No matter how talent, luck, or skill they have, just by being consistent.
But you need to put in the effort.

All the time you’ll spend working hard and failing will make you think you’re a loser.
You’ll feel like a nobody who sucks and isn’t good for anything and should just quit because you’ll never be good enough.
This is how I feel most of the time.
But I'm conscious about this feeling.

Consistency, at its core, is a lonely pursuit.
Commitment to something long-term could lonely, boring, and tedious.
If you ask successful entrepeneurs, they were probably working on their business for years before they got any traction.

To sustain consistency, what I do is tricking my brain into it.

# Building Consistency

I came up with a system to measure how consistent I'm being over time.

What I do:

1. Set ~~easy~~ realistic goals.
2. Track my progress (automatically).
3. Reward myself when hitting milestones.

## Realistic Goals

Every year, I set a few goals that I want to achieve.
I try to keep them small (no more than 5), so I can actually achieve them.

{% linkedin cesarsotovalero_just-before-starting-every-new-year-i-do-activity-7280462841755631617-zaoS %}

Once I set my goals, I lower down barrier to starting to the minimum.
Making daily target so small I can't say no.
For that, I break down complex task in something easy to measure.

For example, if you want to read a book, you can set a goal of reading just 10 pages a day.
If you read 10 pages a day, you'll have read 3,650 pages in a year, which is about 10 books.
If you want to write a blog post, you can set a goal of writing just 200 words a day.
If you write 200 words a day, you'll have written 73,000 words in a year, which is enough for a full-length book.

The key isn't doing a lot in one sitting, but making some little progress every single day.

## Measure the Progress

Use a habit tracker, spreadsheet, or calendar.



For example, I've [automated the way I build](https://github.com/cesarsotovalero/cesarsotovalero.github.io/blob/f5cea42089dad8df514aed0a305dfa98b5dab3f8/.github/workflows/compile-resume-to-pdf.yml) [my resume](https://www.cesarsotovalero.net/files/CV/cesar-resume.pdf) using LaTeX and GitHub actions.
I [created Python scripts](https://github.com/cesarsotovalero/cesarsotovalero.github.io/tree/master/scripts) to scrape the number of subscribers on YouTube, the number of followers on LinkedIn, the number of citations on Google scholar, etc.
I even keep track of [the timings](https://www.cesarsotovalero.net/races.html) for the races I run.

My suggestion:

- **Track your streaks:** How many days in a row did you practice, write, code, or exercise?
- **Count your reps:** How many times did you complete your target activity this week or month?
- **Set minimums:** What is the smallest unit of progress you can commit to every day? (e.g., write 100 words, do 10 pushups, read 1 page)
- **Review your stats:** At the end of each week or month, look at your numbers. Did you hit your targets? Where did you fall short?


## Celebrate Achievements

Celebrating is important.
My PhD supervisor was very serious about celebrating success.
I remember we always celebrated the submission of a new paper.

> Happiness to me is what I feel when consistently achieving my goals.


# Final Thoughts

Everything is difficult before it becomes easy.
Consistency is a superpower.
But only a few people have it because we all have finite energy.
If you want to beat talent, luck, or even your own past self, start measuring it.
Put numbers on it.
What gets measured gets improved.
Rely on systems, rather than willpower.
Try to surround yourself with consistent people.
And no matter what, just don't give up.

[^1]: I'm on my way to become a successful YouTuber (i.e., > 100K subs). I still have a long way to go. If you want to follow my journey, you can [subscribe to my channel](https://www.youtube.com/@cesarsotovalero) 😊.

[^2]: BTW, I believe that writting is one the most tough things to do consistently.

[^3]: I have a friend who is a professional athlete, and he told me that the hardest part of his job is to stay consistent over time. He has to train every day, even when he doesn't feel like it, and that takes a lot of mental strength.

[^4]: Today, AI solves the problem of lacking smart guidance and deliberate learning (i.e., the idea that simple repetition will not bring you very far).
