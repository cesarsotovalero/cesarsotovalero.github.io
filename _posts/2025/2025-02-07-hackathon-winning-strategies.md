# Peder

By interviewing hackathon winners we have identified winning strategies.
Summary

- Really understand the problem and come up with a simple yet effective solution.
- Scope it down. Focus on one aspect of the problem. Don't try to build a system that solves everything related to the problem. You won't have more than a few minutes to present your solution anyway.
- Have a team leader that monitors the project's progress, checks in with each team member about completed tasks and next steps, and identifies any bottlenecks or technical challenges.


## WOW factor
In a hackathon, it's often something the audience has never seen before, made possible by new technology. Typically based on specific competence that can be applied to problem.

## Presentation

Engage the audience, e.g., ask the audience or even the jury for input to the system.

Keep in mind that the audience is not interested in too much talk - they really want to see the system in action.

No pre-recorded videos or PowerPoint presentations. The system must be live-demoed.

## Selected podcast episodes on how to WIN hackathons from Cillers' podcast "World Class Hackathons":

Interview with multiple hackathon winner Anna Amner. Teams with a designated leader consistently perform better at hackathons. A team lead involves monitoring the project's progress, checking in with each team member about completed tasks and next steps, and identifying any bottlenecks or technical challenges. https://open.spotify.com/episode/3drWDvRCdrpGwKjet1d11O?si=ee21276dd7cb4cbf

# About Team lead
Why have a team lead?

Hackathon teams with a lead often perform better, so we recommend all teams to appoint one.

A hackathon team lead is the person who facilitates booking meetings, task assignments, progress check-ins, problem resolution and decision making. The team lead is also responsible for managing the relationship with the non-profit organization.


It is important for us to have a direct contact person for each team that we can check in with, so please let us know who will be your team lead, if you have not already done so.


## Inspiration

Listen to our interview with Amna Hassan. Amna is a section leader at Stanford Code In Place, a former winner of Harvard University's CS50 Puzzle Day, hackathon winner at lablab.ai, a four-time hackathon mentor, twice a hackathon judge, and has participated in over twenty hackathons. She has seldom seen a team win or even reach the finals without a team lead.
