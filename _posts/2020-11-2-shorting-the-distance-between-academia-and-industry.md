Research is about solving relevant problems. However, the relevance of certain problems is a highly subjective matter. Is it relevant to send a human being to Mars? Maybe it is, or maybe not. One thing is for sure: research is _expensive_. It is sustained mostly by funds and grants. I believe that the best way to boost funding is by increasing _interest_ in research investment. Therefore, researchers should dedicate a significant part of their efforts to strengthen the bonds between their work and the local industry. Let's discuss how. 



I argue that research should be more industry focused.

is the goverment, the country, which pais for research grants... so its the industry a necessary boost.

# what do we do?

Research is about solving relevant problems

Disseminate results beyond academia to have impact

Collaborate with a companies and industry.

Fruitful collaboration in the area of software research


# How do we do?

We go there (to the companies), listen to their questions and problems and interact.

We create software events and invite people from industry to present their technology that they deploy on a daily basis.

We disseminate in very focussed industry events in from of a larger crowd of very focused engineers.

Creating github organizations, contributing together with academics, engineers, and the community.

# Why it is challenging?

requires changing our habits

# But

Execellent for mutual innovation

For mutual knownledge sharing
