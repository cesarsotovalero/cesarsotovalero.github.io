Nobody can deny that teaching is hard.
I strongly believe that teaching is one of the most essential skills to learn in this century.
Whether you are a junior software developer or a renowned member of a firm, your ability to communicate your knowledge effectively will determine your future success.

In this 15 min video, I teach how the Quicksort algorithm works the old way: with a blackboard and chalk.
As you can see, I made many mistakes. 
Considering that I spent two hours preparing for this, my performance was not as good as expected.

It was, however, not that bad. Isn't it?

# Wrapping up 

For my this session, these are some preparation tips that helped me:

- Prepare a script of your presentation; having something written helps to clarify ideas and to sharpen the vocabulary for the session
- Record me during the rehearsal: it is incredible the many mistakes that we overlook if we don't see ourselves during the performance
- Move my hands and speak slowly: the corporal language is essential, this is something that I'm still learning from [the best speakers](https://www.ted.com/talks)
- Practice, practice, and practice
