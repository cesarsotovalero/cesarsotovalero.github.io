I have personally come across several programmers who only program in my career. And even though I was a recent junior, I didn't want to work with people like that.

In other words, we don't want programmers who only program, because:
- Since They don't plan, you never know when they finished a task
- As they do not document, there is no god who uses their code because nobody knows how it works.
- Since they don't test, chances are the q-code they write is full of errors.
- As they do not handle servers, their code has only been executed on their machine and the programmer is not responsible for it running correctly in production
- Since they don't put together infrastructure, they don't have the slightest idea of how the hardware works where the code is supposed to work. Any incompatibility problem, or call it, that you don't know, or want to know
- As They don't make refactors... I honestly can't imagine how a software without refactors can evolve...
- As they do not have good English, until the documentation of a technology does not come out in Spanish, they do not know it and that is why they are always behind the stick.
