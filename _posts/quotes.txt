"Technique is that you need to know to do, science is what you need to do to know."

"Those who excel in PhD programs are the ones who recognize how their works fit into a broader research community."

"Action precedes motivation."

"It's not just about the odds of winning a particular game, it has to do with whether the game that you choose to play matches well with the way that the future unfolds."
