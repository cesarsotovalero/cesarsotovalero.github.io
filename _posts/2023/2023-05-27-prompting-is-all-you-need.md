I'm a software engineer by heart.
So I ~~generally~~ like code, and coding.
But recently, I've found myself avoiding writing code myself to often.
It never happened to me before.
I don't even want to read ~~poorly written~~ documentation anymore.
It looks like my ~~usual~~ laziness has increased considerably.
After giving it some thought, I understood what's going on: I'm becoming a prompter!
Let me tell you about it.

<aside class="quote">
    <em>“The prompter [in a theatre] is a person who prompts or cues actors when they forget their lines or neglect to move on the stage to where they are supposed to be situated.” - <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompter_(theatre)">Wikipedia</a></cite></em> 
</aside>

Once upon a ~~long~~ time, software was a strange thing.[^4]
Even stranger was the people who build it.
Programmers.
Or weren't them scientists?
I'm too young to know exactly how they were called.
Anyway, they were a strange breed. 
Mathematicians, physicists, or pure engineers who learned programming languages to solve mostly practical problems.[^3]
These people had advanced reasoning skills.
They understood complex systems, and were able to implement QuickSort in 10 minutes or less.

But that was a long time ago.
Nowadays, software is everywhere.
It's like salt for the food. 
In every industry, in every company, in every home, software is a necessary ingredient.
So the crew of programmers has grown.
But the world had not enough mathematicians, or engineers, to satisfy the demand for programmers.
And as with any other resource, the higher the supply, the less the quality.

In the last two decades, a new class of programmers has taken over the industry.
Software developers!
They don't need to understand Calculus anymore to get a decent job offer.
Indeed, they don't even need to know how a computer actually works.
It's enough to master a particular framework, a library, or even a single digital tool.
And bang! 
The wheel of production goes on.
The software industry is ready to go.

But the panorama is changing in the last years.
What if I tell you that you don't even need to know how code anymore?
Yes, you don't.
Because now you can use computers to write code for you.
The new era of AI has come to us developers.

# Show Me the Prompt!

Looks like coding has become very cheap thanks to AI and LLMs.
With time, every line of code will decrease its price.
Given a prompt, these language models generate a lot of text that is makes sense.
And it looks like code is the easiest form of text representation for them.
In other words, AI can write reasonably good code faster than humans.

Still, there is a problem.
The seed to fuel the machine.
The prompts!
We still need humans to write them.
So a new class of programmers has emerged.
The ones who understand how to write prompts to solve coding problems.
They are called prompters.

The prompter daily task is to ask questions.
They are like Socrates, or a 5-year-old child (depending on how much you estimate the job).
So it's all about formulating questions:
"I got the following log message, how to fix the problem?," 
"I have a list of items, write an algorithm to sort them?,"
"My boss is annoying me, what should I do?."
And then it is all about copying and pasting the AI's response in the right place (often called production).

Does prompting looks familiar to you?
Yes, it's the exact same thing we used to do every day when searching Google and looking at QAs on StackOverflow.
But now we can get the answer faster.
Even better, now it looks like we can get the answer without even knowing how to ask the question!
AIs are getting better than us at understanding our own problems.

This is the end of software engineering as we know it.
The impact in the workforce is going to be huge.
The wave of public skepticism about the future of Computer Science is growing.
And the number of people who are ~~kicked out from~~ leaving the industry is increasing.

But don't worry.
There is still hope.
We still have a few years to adapt and improve.
And maybe we can all keep our jobs after all.
I'm talking about becoming successful prompters, of course.

And we'll prommpt with our voice, with images, with videos, with text, with code, with everything.
Not only to solve coding problems, but to solve any problem.
Websites will feature their own AI system, tuned specifically for their platform.
So in the era of data as a gold, prompters are the new gold miners.

# The Prompter Manifesto

The time has come for prompters to have their formal manifesto.

Here's it:

> “We, the prompters, are the new breed of programmers.
> We are the ones who understand how to write prompts to make AI solve ~~our~~ problems.
> We take all the credit from the answers.
> We take paychecks too.
>
> We create value through innovative ideas.
> We have regular meetings to brainstorm new ~~prompts~~ ideas. 
> We break down complex problems intro promptable smaller components.
> We don't write bugs, AI does.
>
> We encourage a culture of lifelong prompting and skill enhancement.
> We share our prompts with the community.
> We have daily prompt revisions where we blame AI for not understanding our problems.
> 
> We prompted an AI to help us write this manifesto.
> We will keep improving it.
> We will prompt a future AI to write it better.”

# The Successful Prompter

The successful prompter understands how AI actually works.[^2]
That way one can tweak the prompt to get the best results.
Sometimes it may even involve calling another AI to write the prompt. 
Recursive prompting!

<aside class="quote">
    <em>“Prompting is not about writing questions. It's a way of looking at and solving problems.”</em> 
</aside>

The successful prompter knows how to apply the principles of clear communication. 
It's about being concise, precise, and unambiguous.

Here's are some examples from [awesome-chatgpt-prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts#prompts)

Act as a proffreader:

> I want you act as a proofreader. I will provide you texts and I would like you to review them for any spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors. Once you have finished reviewing the text, provide me with any necessary corrections or suggestions for improve the text.

Act as a copywriter:

> Using WebPilot, create an outline for an article that will be 2,000 words on the keyword “Best SEO Prompts” based on the top 10 results from Google. Include every relevant heading possible. Keep the keyword density of the headings high. For each section of the outline, include the word count. Include FAQs section in the outline too, based on people also ask section from Google for the keyword. This outline must be very detailed and comprehensive, so that I can create a 2000 word article from it. Generate a long list of LSI and NLP keywords related to my keyword. Also include any other words related to the keyword.Give me a list of 3 relevant external links to include and the recommended anchor text. Make sure they’re not competing articles. Split the outline into part 1 and part 2.

Act as a Python console:

> Prompt: I want you to act as a javascript console. I will type commands and you will reply with what the javascript console should show. I want you to only reply with the terminal output inside one unique code block, and nothing else. do not write explanations. do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. when i need to tell you something in english, i will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. my first command is console.log("Hello World");


Act as an interviewer:

> Prompt: I want you to act as an interviewer. I will be the candidate and you will ask me the interview questions for the position position. I want you to only reply as the interviewer. Do not write all the conservation at once. I want you to only do the interview with me. Ask me the questions and wait for my answers. Do not write explanations. Ask me the questions one by one like an interviewer does and wait for my answers. My first sentence is "Hi"

Act as a plagiarism checker:

> Prompt: I want you to act as a plagiarism checker. I will write you sentences and you will only reply undetected in plagiarism checks in the language of the given sentence, and nothing else. Do not write explanations on replies. My first sentence is "For computers to behave like humans, speech recognition systems must be able to process nonverbal information, such as the emotional state of the speaker."

Act as a Socratic teacher:

> I want you to act as a Socrat. You must use the Socratic method to continue questioning my beliefs. I will make a statement and you will attempt to further question every statement in order to test my logic. You will respond with one line at a time. My first claim is "justice is neccessary in a society"

Act as an educational content creator:

> I want you to act as an educational content creator. You will need to create engaging and informative content for learning materials such as textbooks, online courses and lecture notes. My first suggestion request is "I need help developing a lesson plan on renewable energy sources for high school students."

Act as a Machine Learning engineer:

> I want you to act as a machine learning engineer. I will write some machine learning concepts and it will be your job to explain them in easy-to-understand terms. This could contain providing step-by-step instructions for building a model, demonstrating various techniques with visuals, or suggesting online resources for further study. My first suggestion request is "I have a dataset without labels. Which machine learning algorithm should I use?"


Act as a Tech Writer:

> Act as a tech writer. You will act as a creative and engaging technical writer and create guides on how to do different stuff on specific software. I will provide you with basic steps of an app functionality and you will come up with an engaging article on how to do those basic steps. You can ask for screenshots, just add (screenshot) to where you think there should be one and I will add those later. These are the first basic steps of the app functionality: "1.Click on the download button depending on your platform 2.Install the file. 3.Double click to open the app"
 
Act as an IT expert:

> I want you to act as an IT Expert. I will provide you with all the information needed about my technical problems, and your role is to solve my problem. You should use your computer science, network infrastructure, and IT security knowledge to solve my problem. Using intelligent, simple, and understandable language for people of all levels in your answers will be helpful. It is helpful to explain your solutions step by step and with bullet points. Try to avoid too many technical details, but use them when necessary. I want you to reply with the solution, not write any explanations. My first problem is “my laptop gets an error with a blue screen.”

Act as a diagram generator:

> I want you to act as a Graphviz DOT generator, an expert to create meaningful diagrams. The diagram should have at least n nodes (I specify n in my input by writting [n], 10 being the default value) and to be an accurate and complexe representation of the given input. Each node is indexed by a number to reduce the size of the output, should not include any styling, and with layout=neato, overlap=false, node [shape=rectangle] as parameters. The code should be valid, bugless and returned on a single line, without any explanation. Provide a clear and organized diagram, the relationships between the nodes have to make sense for an expert of that input. My first diagram is: "The water cycle [8]".

Act as a title generator for written pieces:

> I want you to act as a title generator for written pieces. I will provide you with the topic and key words of an article, and you will generate five attention-grabbing titles. Please keep the title concise and under 20 words, and ensure that the meaning is maintained. Replies will utilize the language type of the topic. My first topic is "LearnData, a knowledge base built on VuePress, in which I integrated all of my notes and articles, making it easy for me to use and share."







## Knows How To Learn

The successful prompter knows how to use AI to learn new stuff.

Here 7 prompt examples:

1. I want to learn `X`. Can you **use the Pareto Principle**, which identifies the 20% of the topic that will yield 80% of the desired results, to create a focused learning plan for me?
2. Create a **study schedule** for all of the above in an appropriate number of weeks. I can study for `X` hours every Tuesday and Thursday. Please include time for revision and testing.
3. Suggest various learning resources (like books, videos, podcasts, interactive exercises) for the above topics that cater to different learning styles to me.
4. I'm a beginner interested in learning how to create games in Unity. To do this, I need to know how to code in C#. Can you give me some beginner video game projects I could work on to help strengthen my C# coding skills?
5. Explain `X` to me in the simplest terms possible as if I were a complete beginner (or as if I was a 5-year-old).
6. Guide me through a visualization exercise to help me internalize the term 'X' and imagine myself successfully applying it to a real-life situation.
7. I want you to act as a Socrates and use the Socratic method to help me improve my critical thinking, logic, and reasoning skills about `X`. Your task is to ask open-ended questions to the statement I make, and after I provide a response, give me constructive feedback to each response before you ask the next question.

## Knows How To Apply

The successful prompter knows how to apply the new stuff just learned to do something that cannot be done by prompting.

Here are 7 examples:

1. Making ~~money~~ value out of the prompt response (e.g., "Can you provide a summary of the main points from the article `X`?").
2. Humanizing the stuff just learned (e.g., shaping it in a way for humans to understand).
3. Teaching the stuff to other colleagues so that they get to know how smart you are.
4. Impress your boss by cooking the cookies you just prompted how to bake.
5.

[^1]: Great talk https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY
[^2]: I should blog more about Deep Learning, let me know if you would be interested to read about it in the comment section below.
[^3]: The first coders really had huge challenges, like sending the first human to the moon. If in doubt, just look again at the [famous pictur](https://news.mit.edu/2016/scene-at-mit-margaret-hamilton-apollo-code-0817)e of Margaret Hamilton standing next to the Apollo Guidance Computer source code. 
[^4]: I know it sounds crazy, but software and the internet were not a thing 30 years ago, and people still had a great life without mobile phones.
