# Learning 

## Learning something new

Prompts:

1. I want to learn `X`. Can you **use the Pareto Principle**, which identifies the 20% of the topic that will yield 80% of the desired results, to create a focused learning plan for me?
2. Create a **study schedule** for all of the above in an appropriate amount of weeks. I can study for `X` hours every Tuesday and Thursday. Please include time for revision and testing.
3. Suggest me various learning resources (like books, videos, podcasts, interactive exercises) for the above topics that cater to different learning styles.
4. I am a beginner interested in learning how to create games in Unity. To do this, I need to know how to code in C#. Can you give me some beginner video game projects I could work on to help strengthen my C# coding skills?
5. Explain [topic] to me in the simplest terms possible as if I were a complete beginner. (or as if I was a 5-year-old)
6. Guide me through a visualization exercise to help me internalize the term opportunity cost and imagine myself successfully applying it to a real-life situation.
7. I want you to act as a Socrates and use the Socratic method to help me improve my critical thinking, logic, and reasoning skills. Your task is to ask open-ended questions to the statement I make, and after I provide a response, give me constructive feedback to each response before you ask the next question.
