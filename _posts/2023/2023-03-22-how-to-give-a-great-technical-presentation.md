Public speaking has never being my thing.
When I was a child, I remember feeling afraid of standing out from the rest.
Showcasing myself publicly was like a nightmare, maybe due to the fear of feeling ridiculous.
With the time, I have understood that talent and hard work doesn't really matter if you can't present your work professionally.
So there is actually no option for professionals, it's the job market, and there's nothing we can do to change it.
This is a pesky initiation rite that never ends, starting from the education system, and then during [hiring interviews](../blog/securing-a-permanent-job-in-sweden-before-completing-my-phd.html#interviews), and going all the way to the granddaddy of them all, the PhD defense.
I kid you not, my early days as a presenter at KTH were a disaster movie in the making.
Shaky voice? Check. Incoherent ramblings?
Double check.
But hey, you live and learn, right?
After five years of enduring all sorts of presentations, good, bad, and downright ugly, I've picked up a trick or two.
Sure, I've bombed more presentations than I'd care to admit, but that's just given me a front-row seat to the dos and don'ts of the presenting world.
And let me tell you, I've got stories that could make seasoned professionals squirm!
So, pull up a chair, grab some popcorn, and let's dive into this crash course on nailing your next big presentation.
After all, if I could do it, so can you!

TL;DR: The secret to delivering a great presentation lies in showcasing and embodying confidence.

From Yegor Bugayenko's [blog](https://www.yegor256.com/2019/04/23/how-to-give-a-great-technical-presentation.html):

- Don't be obvious!
- Don't exaggerate with jokes!
- Don't be too informal, be serious!
- Don't give the same presentation more than once!
- Don't bring kitties!
- Don't finish without a Q&A!

# How to start

The easiest subjects to start with are stories about your practical experience with some modern technologies and tools, something like “How Docker Helps Us Optimize Delivery” or “Five Apache Spark Installation Issues.” Just describe what you’ve done on a recent project. It doesn’t really matter what you talk about. What matters is that you’re visible. If the market accepts you, the employer will trust you more. That’s exactly what you need in order to request a higher rate.

As Steve Jobs famously said, "People who know what they're talking about don't need PowerPoint." Yet, crafting an engaging presentation without slides can indeed be a significant challenge.

# Transcript:

## Intro

- Students shouldn't go out into life without the ability to communicate, and that's because your success in life will be determined largely by your ability to speak, your ability to write, and the quality of your ideas, in that order.

- The quality of our communication, your speaking, your writing, is largely determined by how much **knowledge** you have, how much you **practice** with that knowledge (KPT), and your inherent **talent** (T is very small). What really matters is what you know.

Quality = f(K, P, T)

- So you can get a lot better than people who may have inherent talents if you have the right amount of knowledge.

- You want to get the maximum opportunity to have your ideas valued and accepted by the people you speak with.

## How to start

- Don't start a talk with a joke. The reason is that, in the beginning of a talk, people are still putting their laptops away. They're becoming adjusted to your speaking parameters, to your vocal parameters, and they're not ready for a joke. So it doesn't work very well. They usually fall flat.

- Instead, **the best way to start is with empowerment promise.** You want to tell people what they're going to know at the end of the hour that they didn't know at the beginning of the hour. It's an empowerment promise. It's the reason for being here. 

- What would be an example? Oh, I see. At the end of this 60 minutes, you will know things about speaking you don't know now, and something among those things you know will make a difference in your life.

## Four tricks
 
1. Make sure to **cycle on the subject**. Go around it. Go round it again. Go round it again. Some people say, tell him what you want to tell him. Tell him again, and then tell him a third time, as if people weren't intelligent. But the point is that, at any given moment, about 20% of you will be fogged out no matter what the lecture is. So if you want to ensure that the probability that everybody gets it is high, you need to say it three times. So cycling is one of the things that I always think about when I give a talk. 
 
2. **Put a fence around your idea**. Explain the idea in a way that it's not confused with somebody else's idea. So in a more technical sense, I might say, well, my algorithm might seem similar to Jones's algorithm, except his is exponential, and mine's linear. That's putting a fence around your idea so that people can not be confused about how it might relate to something else. 
 
3. **Verbal punctuation**. People will occasionally fog out and need to get back on the bus, so you need to provide some landmark places where you're announcing that it's a good time to get back on, e.g., an outline enumerating the key ideas to provide a sense that there's a seam in the talk, and you can get back on. 
 
4. **Ask a question**. Wait and not say anything for seven seconds, but that's the standard amount of time you can wait for an answer. And of course, the question has to be carefully chosen. It can't be too obvious because then people will be embarrassed to say it, but the answers can't be too hard because then nobody will have anything to say. 

## Build your personal style

If you watch the speakers you admire and feel are effective, and ask yourselves why they're successful, then you can build up your own personal repertoire and develop your own personal style.
 
- **Time**. In the morning, at 11AM, most people at MIT are awake by then. Not right after a meal. At 11AM, people aren't fatigued from this or that. It's a great time to have a lecture. 
 
- **Place**. The most important thing about the place is that it be well lit. The reason is that we humans, whenever the lights go down, or whenever the room is dimly lighted, it signals that we should go to sleep. So whenever I go somewhere to give a talk, the first thing I do when I speak to the audio-visual people is say, keep the lights full up. Go to see the place before the actual talk to make sure you know about any weirdnesses in advance, so that you'll be able to deal with it. Sometimes, it might require some intervention. Sometimes, it just might require me to understand what the challenges are.
 
- **Boards, props, and slides**. The board is the right tool when the purpose is informing. The slides are good when your purpose is exposing. 

> Many people who are novices at speaking find themselves suddenly aware of their hands.

- **Props**.  There are tools or accessories that you can use to make sure your talk is memorable. For example, use props to show the importance of looking at the problem in the right way. 

Board + Props = Empathetic Mirroring (you can feel yourself writing on the blackboard, you need to see it in the pysical world)

- **Slides**. There are always too many slides, always too many words. One of the things you shouldn't do is read your slides. People in your audience know how to read, and reading will just annoy them. Also, you should be sure that you have only a few words on each slide, and that the words are easy to read. You want the slides to be condiments to what you're saying, not the main event or the opposite way around. So how can we fix this? Step number one is to get rid of the background junk. That's always distraction. Step number two is to get rid of the words. Get rid of the logos. We don't need them. Simplification. What else can we do? Get rid of the title. By reducing the number of words on the slide, I'm allowing you to pay more attention to me and less to what's written on the slide. Remember that we have only one language processor, and we can either use it to read stuff or to listen to the speaker. And so if we have too many words on the slide, it forces people in the audience to read this stuff and not listen. No reason even for those bullets. Don't use any kind of laser pointers, those are distracting because you loose the contact with your audience, instead, this is what you do: put a little arrow on there tell the audience to look at that. You can have one complex slide per work, one per presentation, one per paper, one per book. That's what [hapax legomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hapax_legomenon).


## How to inspire 

promise like I did for this hour that we're going through now. And then it comes to the question of how do you inspire people? I've given this talk for a long time, and a few years ago, our department chairman said, would you please give this talk to a new faculty, and be sure to emphasize what it takes to inspire students. And strangely, I hadn't thought about that question before. So I started a survey. I'd talked to some of my
  incoming freshmen advisees, and I talked to senior faculty and everything in between about how they've been inspired. What I found from the incoming freshmen is that they were inspired by some high school teacher who told them they could do it. What I found in the senior faculty, they were inspired by someone who helped them see a problem in a new way. And what I saw from everyone is that they were inspired when someone exhibited passion about what they were doing, exhibited passion about what they were doing. So that's one way to be inspiring. It's easy for me because I do artificial intelligence. And how can you not be interested in artificial intelligence? [LAUGHTER] I mean, if you're not interested in artificial intelligence, you're probably not interested in interesting things. So when I'm lecturing in my AI class, it's natural for me to talk about what I think is cool and how exciting some new idea is. So that's the kind of expression of passion that makes a difference while
  informing with respect to this question of inspiring. Oh, yeah and of course, during this promise phase, you can also express how cool stuff is. Let me give you an example of a lecture that starts this way. I'm talking about resource allocation. It's the same sort of stuff you would think of when your-- it's the same sort of ideas you would need if you're allocating aircraft to a flight schedule or trying to schedule a factory or something like that. But the example is putting colors on the states in the United States without any bordering states having the same color. So here it goes. This is what I show at the beginning of the class. This is a way of doing that coloring. And you might say, well, why don't we wait till it finishes? Would you like to do that? No? Well, we're not going to wait till it finishes because the sun will have exploded and consumed the earth before this program finishes. [LAUGHTER] But with a slight adjustment to how the program works, which I tell my
  students you will understand in the next 50 minutes, this is what you get. Isn't that cool? You got to be amazed by stuff that takes a computation from longer than the lifetime of the solar system into a few seconds. So that's what I mean by providing a promise upfront and expressing some passion about what you're talking about. Well, the last item in this little block here is it has to do with what people think that they do it at MIT. You ask faculty what the most important purpose is, and they'll say, well, the most important thing I do is teach people how to think. And then you say oh, that's great. How do you teach people how to think? Blank stare. No one can quite respond to that part, that natural next question. So how do you teach people how to think? Well, I believe that we are storytelling animals. And that we start developing our story, understanding and manipulating skills with fairy tales in childhood and continue on through professional schools like law, business,
  medicine, everything. And we continue doing that throughout life. So if that is what thinking is all about. And we want to teach people how to think, you provide them with the stories they need to know, the questions they need to ask about those stories, mechanisms for analyzing those stories, ways of putting stories together, ways of evaluating how reliable a story is. And that's what I think you need to do when you teach people how to think. But that's all about education. And many of you here are not necessarily for that, but rather for this part, for persuading, which breaks down into several categories, oral exams, not shown, shop talks, getting famous. I won't say much about oral exams other than the fact that they used to be a lot scarier than they are today. In the old days, reading the literature in a foreign language was a part of that. And there was a high failure rate. And when you look back on those failures, the most usual reason for people failing an oral exam is
  failure to situate and a failure to practice. By situate, I mean, it's important to talk about your research in context. This is a problem that's being pursued all over the world. There hasn't been any progress before me in the past 30 years. Everyone is looking for a solution because it will have impact on so many other things, such situating and time and place and feel. And then as far as practice is concerned, yes, practice is important. But that doesn't mean showing your slides to the people you share an with. The problem with that is that if people know what you're doing, they will hallucinate that there's material in your presentation that isn't there if it isn't there. A variation on the scene, by the way, is your faculty supervisor is not a very good person to help you debug a talk because they, in fact, know what you're doing. And they will, in fact, hallucinate there's material in your presentation that isn't there. So you need to get together with some friends who don't
  know what you're doing and have them-- well, you start the practice session by saying, if you can't make me cry, I won't value as a friend anymore. [LAUGHTER] And then when you get to the faculty on a oral exam, it will be easy. You see, difficulty-- the amount of flak you'll get from somebody is proportional to age. The older somebody is, the more they understand where they are in the world. But the young people are trying to show the old people how smart they are, so it's subtly vicious. So whenever you have an opportunity to have an examining committee that's full of people with gray hair, that's what you want. Well, that's just a word or two about something I haven't listed here. Let's get into the subject of job talks. So I was sitting in a bar many years ago in San Diego. I was a member of the Navy Science Board, and I was sitting with a couple of my colleagues on the board Delores Etter from the University of Colorado. She made me so jealous I could spit because she'd written
  21 books, and I'd only written 17. And then the other one was Bill Weldon from the University of Texas. He was an electromagnetism guy, and he knew how to use rail guns to drive steel rods through tank armor. These were interesting people. So I said, what do you look for in a faculty candidate? And within one microsecond, Delores said, they have to show us they've got some kind of vision, quickly followed by Bill who said, they have to show us that they've done something. Oh, that sounds good, I said. And then I said to them, how long does a candidate have to establish these two things? What do you think? Well, compare your answer to theirs. Five minutes. So if you haven't expressed your vision, if you haven't told people that you've done something in five minutes, you've already lost. So you have to be able to do that. And let me just mention a couple of things in that connection. Here, the vision is in part, a problem that somebody cares about and something new in your approach. So
  the problem is understanding the nature of human intelligence. And the approach is asking questions about what makes us different from chimpanzees and Neanderthals. Is it merely a matter of quantity, or we're just a little bit smarter in some continuous way? Or do we have something that's fundamentally different that chimpanzees don't have and Neanderthals either? And the answer is yes, we do have something different. We are symbolic creatures. And because we're symbolic creatures, we can build symbolic descriptions of relations and events. We can string them together and make stories. And because we can make stories, that's what makes us different. So that's my stump speech. That's how I start most of my talks on my own personal research. How do you express the notion that you've done something? By listing the steps that need to be taken in order to achieve the solution to that problem. You don't have to have done all of those steps. But you can say here's what needs to be done. An
  example, here's what needs to be done. We need to specify some behavior. We need to enumerate the constraints that make it possible to deal with that behavior. We have to implement a system because we're engineers, and we don't think that we've understood something unless we can build it. And we've built such a system, and we're about to demonstrate it to you today. That would be an example of enumerating a series of steps needed to realize the vision. So then blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then you conclude by-- you conclude by enumerating your contributions. It's kind of mirror of these steps. And it helps to establish that you've done something. So that's a kind of general purpose framework for doing a technical talk. Now, only a few more things left to do today. Getting famous is the next item on our agenda because once you've got the job, you need to think a little bit about how you're going to be recognized for what you do. So oh, first of all, why should
  you care about getting famous? I thought about this in connection with a fundraising event I attended once, a fundraising event for raising money to save Venice from going under water and having all of its art destroyed. Anyway, I was sitting here, and JC was sitting here. That was Julia, the late Julia Child. And as the evening wore on, more and more people would come up and ask Julia to autograph something or express a feeling that she had changed their life. And it just happened over and over again. So eventually, I turned to Julia, and I said, Ms. Child, is it fun to be famous? And she thought about it for a second. And she said, you get used to it. [LAUGHTER] But you know what occured to me? You never get used to being ignored. So it's-- here's a way to think about it. Your ideas are like your children. And you don't want them to go into the world in rags. So what you want to do is to be sure that you have these techniques, these mechanisms, these thoughts about how to present
  ideas that you have so that they're recognized for the value that is in them. So that's why it's a legitimate thing to concern yourself with packaging. Now, how do you get remembered? Well, there's something I like to call Winston's star. And every one of the items I'm about to articulate starts with an S. So if you want your presentation ideas to be remembered, one of the things you need to do is to make sure that you have some kind of symbol associated with your work. So this arch example is actually from my PhD thesis many, many years ago. And in the course of my work at that time, this work on arch learning became mildly famous, and I didn't know why. It was only many years later that I realized that that work accidentally had all of the elements on this star. So the first element is that there was a kind of symbol. It's the arch itself. Next thing you need is some kind of slogan, a kind of phrase that provides a handle on the work. And in this case, the phrase was one shot
  learning. And it was one shot because the program I wrote learned something definite from every example that was presented to us. So in going from a model based on this configuration to something that isn't an arch base on that configuration, the program learned that it has to be on top, one shot learning. So that's a symbol, slogan. And now we need a surprise. Yeah, the surprise is you don't need a million examples of something to learn. You can do it with one example if you're smart enough to make use of that example appropriately. So that was the surprise. You can learn something definite from each example. Next item was a salient idea. Now, when I say salient idea, I don't mean important. What I mean is an idea that sticks out. Some theses, funnily enough, have too many good ideas, and you don't know what it's all about because which one is it? So you need an idea that sticks out. And the idea that stuck out here was the notion of a near miss. You see, this is not an arch, but it
  doesn't miss by much. So it's a near miss. And finally, you need to tell the story of how you did it, how it works, why it's important. So that's a bit on how to not so much get famous, but how to ensure that your work is recognized. Well, we're almost finished because now we're down to this last item, which is how to stop. And when we come to that, there's a question of all right, well, what is the final slide? And what are the final words? So for the final slide, let me give you some examples of possibilities. How about this one? Well, you might see that slide and think to yourself, there are 1,000 faculty at MIT. Nice piece of work, but not so much, but it's only a tiny piece of work if you divide by 1,000. So when you show a whole gigantic list of collaborators at the end of a talk, it's a kind of let down because it suggests that nobody knows. Well, did you do anything significant? Now, you've got to recognize your collaborators, right? So where do you do that? Not on the last
  slide, on the first slide. All this was on the first slide. These are the collaborators, so you don't want to put them at the end. You don't want a slide like this. How about this one? This is the worst possible way to end a talk. [LAUGHTER] Because this slide can be up there for 20 minutes. I've seen it happen. It squanders real estate. It squanders an opportunity to tell people who you are. It's just-- What about this one? I often see it. I never see anybody write it down. Also, it wastes opportunity. Oh my God, even worse. All of these lines do nothing for you. They waste an opportunity for you to tell people-- to leave people with what you-- with who you are. Well, what about this? Is this a good one? It might seem so at first, but here's the problem. If you say these are my conclusions, these are perfectly legitimate conclusions that nobody cares about. What they care about is what you have done. And that's why your final slide should have this label, contributions. It's a
  mirror of what I said over there about how job talks ought to be like a sandwich. And the final slide, the one that's up there while people are asking questions and filing out, it ought to be the one that has your contributions on it. Here's an example from my own stump speech. Yeah, this is what I talk about a lot. Yes, here are the things that I typically demonstrate. And I wait for people to read it. And the final element there is this is what we get out of it, so that's an example of a contribution slide. All right, now, what about the other part? You got your final slide up there. It's a contribution slide. Somehow you have to tell people you're finished. So let's see it, check out a few possibilities. One thing you could do in the final words is you could tell a joke. It's OK. By the time you're done, people have adjusted themselves to your voice parameters. They're ready for a joke. I was sitting in another bar, this time in Austin, Texas with a colleague of mine named Doug
  Lenat. And Doug's a fantastic speaker. And so I said to Doug, Doug, you're a fantastic speaker, what's your secret? And he said, oh, I always finish with a joke, and that way, people think they've had fun the whole time. [LAUGHTER] So yeah, a joke will work down there. How about this one? Thank you. I don't recommend it. It's a weak move. You will not go to hell if you conclude your talk by saying thank you, but it's a weak move, and here's why. When you say thank you, even worse, thank you for listening, it suggests that everybody has stayed that long out of politeness and that they had a profound desire to be somewhere else. But they're so polite, they stuck it out. And that's what you're thanking them for. So once wild applause has started, you can mouth a thank you, and there's nothing wrong with that. But the last thing you do should not be saying thank you. Now, you say to me, well, doesn't everybody say thank you? Well, what everybody does is not necessarily the right thing.
  And I like to illustrate how some talks can end without saying thank you. I like to draw from political speeches, but the ones that I've heard recently aren't so good, so-- [LAUGHTER] So I'm going to have to go go back a little bit. So here is Governor Christie. He gave the Republican keynote address one year. This is the end of his talk. Let's see what he does. [APPLAUSE] CHRIS CHRISTIE: And together, everybody, together. We will stand up once again for American greatness for our children and grandchildren. God bless you, and God bless America. [APPLAUSE] PATRICK WINSTON: So that's a classic benediction ending. God bless you, God bless America. Now, I don't want to be partisan about this. So I think I'd better switch to the keynote address in the Democratic Convention. It was delivered that year by Bill Clinton, who knows something about how to speak. [APPLAUSE] BILL CLINTON: If that is what you want, if that is what you believe, you must vote, and you must re-elect President Barack
  Obama. God bless you, and God bless America. [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] PATRICK WINSTON: Now, watch this. Let's go back a little bit and redo it. What I want you to see is that at one point, he seems to be almost pressing his lips together, forcing himself not to say thank you. Then there's another place where he does a little salute. So watch for those this time around. [APPLAUSE] BILL CLINTON: If that is what you want, if that is what you believe, you must vote, and you must re-elect President Barack Obama. God bless you., and God bless America. [APPLAUSE] PATRICK WINSTON: That's where he's pursing his lips. [LAUGHTER] There's the salute. [LAUGHTER] Yeah, I think that's pretty good. Now, what are we gonna take away from this? Well, I suppose I could conclude this talk by saying God bless you, and God bless the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but it might not work so well. But what you can get out of this is you don't have to say thank you. There are other things you can do. And
  it's interesting that over time, people figure this out, and there's some stock ways of ending things. So in the Catholic church, and the good old Latin mass, it ended with ite missa est, which translates approximately to OK, the mass is over, you can go home now. [LAUGHTER] And of course, at musical concerts, you know that it's time to clap not at the end of the song, but rather when the conductor goes over and shakes hands with the concert master. Those are conventions that tell you that the event is over. So those are all possibilities for here. But one more possibility, and that is that you can salute the audience. And by that, I mean, you can say something about how much you value your time at a place. So I could say, well, it's been great fun being here. It's been fascinating to see what you folks are doing here at MIT. I've been much stimulated and provoked by the kinds of questions you've been asking, it's been really great. And I look forward to coming back on many occasions
  in the future. So that salutes the audience. You can do that. Well, there it is. You know what? I'm glad you're here. And the reason is by being here, I think you have demonstrated an understanding that how you present and how you package your ideas is an important thing. And I salute you for that. [LAUGHTER] And I suggest that you come back again and bring your friends. [APPLAUSE]
