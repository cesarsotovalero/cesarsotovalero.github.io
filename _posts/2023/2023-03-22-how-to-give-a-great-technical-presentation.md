Public speaking has never being easy for me.
When being a child, I was cautious of not standing out from the rest.[^1]
Today, I have understood that there is not way to avoid going public when pursuing professional excellence.
Talent and hard work doesn't really matter if I can't package and present my work to the masses.
I recently did [my PhD thesis defense](https://youtu.be/Ub684G_aM5Q) at KTH (it went well, if you ask me), and want to take the change to reflect on 
what I've learnt during these years about technical presentations.
The last five years enduring all sorts of presentations made me going from shaky voice and incoherent ramblings, to the point in which I sort of feel confident at public speaking.
So, in this article, I'll tell you about the tricks I've learnt.
If you follow all these tips, no doubts you'll be able to nailing your next technical presentation.

# BTW, what is a technical presentation?

Let me start by giving a general definition of what a technical presentation is: 

> "A technical presentation is a communication session in which a speaker delivers specialized information, explanations, or demonstrations on a specific technical topic to an audience."

Now, let's decompose its keywords:

- **"communication session"**: It refers to the format of the presentation. For example: conference talks, tech workshops, webinars, product sales pitches, etc.
- **"delivers specialized information, explanations, or demonstrations"**: The speaker focuses on delivering technical content in a clear, concise, and engaging manner.
- **"technical topic"**: Technical presentations often involve the use of visual aids such as slides, diagrams, code snippets, demonstrations, or multimedia elements to support and enhance the content delivery.



TL;DR: The secret to delivering a great presentation lies in showcasing and embodying confidence.

- Don't be obvious!
- Don't exaggerate with jokes!
- Don't be too informal, be serious!
- Don't give the same presentation more than once!
- Don't bring kitties!
- Don't finish without a Q&A!

# How to start

The easiest subjects to start with are stories about your practical experience with some modern technologies and tools, something like “How Docker Helps Us Optimize Delivery” or “Five Apache Spark Installation Issues.” Just describe what you’ve done on a recent project. It doesn’t really matter what you talk about. What matters is that you’re visible. If the market accepts you, the employer will trust you more. That’s exactly what you need in order to request a higher rate.

As Steve Jobs famously said, "People who know what they're talking about don't need PowerPoint." Yet, crafting an engaging presentation without slides can indeed be a significant challenge.

# Transcript:

## Intro

- Students shouldn't go out into life without the ability to communicate, and that's because your success in life will be determined largely by your ability to speak, your ability to write, and the quality of your ideas, in that order.

- The quality of our communication, your speaking, your writing, is largely determined by how much **knowledge** you have, how much you **practice** with that knowledge (KPT), and your inherent **talent** (T is very small). What really matters is what you know.

Quality = f(K, P, T)

- So you can get a lot better than people who may have inherent talents if you have the right amount of knowledge.

- You want to get the maximum opportunity to have your ideas valued and accepted by the people you speak with.

## How to start

- Don't start a talk with a joke. The reason is that, in the beginning of a talk, people are still putting their laptops away. They're becoming adjusted to your speaking parameters, to your vocal parameters, and they're not ready for a joke. So it doesn't work very well. They usually fall flat.

- Instead, **the best way to start is with empowerment promise.** You want to tell people what they're going to know at the end of the hour that they didn't know at the beginning of the hour. It's an empowerment promise. It's the reason for being here. 

- What would be an example? Oh, I see. At the end of this 60 minutes, you will know things about speaking you don't know now, and something among those things you know will make a difference in your life.

- The first slide should contain the list of collaborator or institutions that made your work possible.

## Four tricks
 
1. Make sure to **cycle on the subject**. Go around it. Go round it again. Go round it again. Some people say, tell him what you want to tell him. Tell him again, and then tell him a third time, as if people weren't intelligent. But the point is that, at any given moment, about 20% of you will be fogged out no matter what the lecture is. So if you want to ensure that the probability that everybody gets it is high, you need to say it three times. So cycling is one of the things that I always think about when I give a talk. 
 
2. **Put a fence around your idea**. Explain the idea in a way that it's not confused with somebody else's idea. So in a more technical sense, I might say, well, my algorithm might seem similar to Jones's algorithm, except his is exponential, and mine's linear. That's putting a fence around your idea so that people can not be confused about how it might relate to something else. 
 
3. **Verbal punctuation**. People will occasionally fog out and need to get back on the bus, so you need to provide some landmark places where you're announcing that it's a good time to get back on, e.g., an outline enumerating the key ideas to provide a sense that there's a seam in the talk, and you can get back on. 
 
4. **Ask a question**. Wait and not say anything for seven seconds, but that's the standard amount of time you can wait for an answer. And of course, the question has to be carefully chosen. It can't be too obvious because then people will be embarrassed to say it, but the answers can't be too hard because then nobody will have anything to say. 

## Build your personal style

If you watch the speakers you admire and feel are effective, and ask yourselves why they're successful, then you can build up your own personal repertoire and develop your own personal style.
 
- **Time**. In the morning, at 11AM, most people at MIT are awake by then. Not right after a meal. At 11AM, people aren't fatigued from this or that. It's a great time to have a lecture. 
 
- **Place**. The most important thing about the place is that it be well lit. The reason is that we humans, whenever the lights go down, or whenever the room is dimly lighted, it signals that we should go to sleep. So whenever I go somewhere to give a talk, the first thing I do when I speak to the audio-visual people is say, keep the lights full up. Go to see the place before the actual talk to make sure you know about any weirdnesses in advance, so that you'll be able to deal with it. Sometimes, it might require some intervention. Sometimes, it just might require me to understand what the challenges are.
 
- **Boards, props, and slides**. The board is the right tool when the purpose is informing. The slides are good when your purpose is exposing. 

> Many people who are novices at speaking find themselves suddenly aware of their hands.

- **Props**.  There are tools or accessories that you can use to make sure your talk is memorable. For example, use props to show the importance of looking at the problem in the right way. 

Board + Props = Empathetic Mirroring (you can feel yourself writing on the blackboard, you need to see it in the pysical world)

- **Slides**. There are always too many slides, always too many words. One of the things you shouldn't do is read your slides. People in your audience know how to read, and reading will just annoy them. Also, you should be sure that you have only a few words on each slide, and that the words are easy to read. You want the slides to be condiments to what you're saying, not the main event or the opposite way around. So how can we fix this? Step number one is to get rid of the background junk. That's always distraction. Step number two is to get rid of the words. Get rid of the logos. We don't need them. Simplification. What else can we do? Get rid of the title. By reducing the number of words on the slide, I'm allowing you to pay more attention to me and less to what's written on the slide. Remember that we have only one language processor, and we can either use it to read stuff or to listen to the speaker. And so if we have too many words on the slide, it forces people in the audience to read this stuff and not listen. No reason even for those bullets. Don't use any kind of laser pointers, those are distracting because you loose the contact with your audience, instead, this is what you do: put a little arrow on there tell the audience to look at that. You can have one complex slide per work, one per presentation, one per paper, one per book. That's what [hapax legomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hapax_legomenon).

## How to inspire 

How do you inspire people? 

- What I found from the incoming freshmen is that they were inspired by some high school teacher who told them they could do it.
- What I found in the senior faculty, they were inspired by someone who helped them see a problem in a new way. 
- What I saw from everyone is that they were inspired when someone exhibited passion about what they were doing

[//]: # (TODO: Put an example of someone that got inspired by somethind thad I did/said)

[//]: # (TODO: Write an example of something cool that I expressed with passion)

- Teach people how to think by telling stories. You provide them with the stories they need to know, the questions they need to ask about those stories, mechanisms for analyzing those stories, ways of putting stories together, ways of evaluating how reliable a story is. And that's what I think you need to do when you teach people how to think. 
 
- **Situate on time, place, and feel.** It's important to talk about your topic in context. For example, say something lik "this is a problem that's being pursued all over the world, here hasn't been any progress before me in the past 30 years, so everyone is looking for a solution because it will have impact on X and Y". 
 
- **Practice.** Don't show your slides to the people you will present to. If they know what you're doing, they will hallucinate that there's material in your presentation that isn't there if it isn't there. A variation on the scene, by the way, is your faculty supervisor is not a very good person to help you debug a talk because they, in fact, know what you're doing. And they will, in fact, hallucinate there's material in your presentation that isn't there. So you need to get together with some friends who don't know what you're doing and have them.
 
> Start your practice session by saying: if you can't make me cry, I won't value as a friend anymore."

- **Feedback.** The amount of flak you'll get from somebody is proportional to age. The older somebody is, the more they understand where they are in the world. But the young people are trying to show the old people how smart they are, so it's subtly vicious. So whenever you have an opportunity to have an examining committee that's full of people with gray hair, that's what you want. 

## Job talks 

If you haven't expressed your vision, if you haven't told people that you've done something in 5 minutes, you've already lost. 

Concretely, you have 5 minutes to:

1. **Show you have some kind of vision** It is a problem that somebody care about and that there's something new in your approach. 

2. **Show you have done something to solve the problem.** By listing the steps that need to be taken in order to realize the vision. You don't have to have done all of those steps. But you can say here's what needs to be done.

Here's an example:

| Problem                     | Approach                                                                                                                                                                                               | Done                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Getting recognized

- **Why do you want to be recognized for what you do?**. None gets used to be ignored. Your ideas are like your children. And you don't want them to go into the world in rags. So what you want to do is to be sure that you have these techniques, these mechanisms, these thoughts about how to present ideas that you have so that they're recognized for the value that is in them. So that's why it's a legitimate thing to concern yourself with packaging. 
 
- **How do you get remembered?** One of the things you need to do is to make sure that you have some kind of **symbol** associated with your work. Next thing you need is some kind of **slogan**, a kind of phrase that provides a handle on the work. And now we need a **surprise**. Next item was a **salient idea**. An idea that sticks out. Some theses, funnily enough, have too many good ideas, and you don't know what it's all about because which one is it? So you need an idea that sticks out. And finally, you need to **tell the story of how you did it, how it works, why it's important**.

## How to finish

- **What is in the final slide?** It's an opportunity for you to tell people who you are and what you have done. And that's why your final slide should have this label, contributions.

- **What are the final words?** One thing you could do in the final words is you could tell a joke. By the time you're done, people have adjusted themselves to your voice parameters. They're ready for a joke, and that way, people think they've had fun the whole time.

> Finishing with "Thank you" is a weak move. When you say thank you, even worse, thank you for listening, it suggests that everybody has stayed that long out of politeness and that they had a profound desire to be somewhere else. But they're so polite, they stuck it out. And that's what you're thanking them for. So once wild applause has started, you can mouth a thank you, and there's nothing wrong with that. But the last thing you do should not be saying thank you.


You can salute the audience, and you can say something about how much you value your time at a place. So I could say, well, "it's been great fun being here. I've been much stimulated and provoked by the kinds of questions you've been asking, it's been really great. And I look forward to coming back on many occasions
  in the future." So that salutes the audience.
