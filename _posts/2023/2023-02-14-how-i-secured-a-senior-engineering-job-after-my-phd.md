A PhD has a time constrained endeavour.
For me, it was 5 years of full-time research.
After that, I had to decide whether to continue in academia or to look for a job in industry.
I chose the latter.[^1]
I recently accepted a job offer as a senior Data Engineer at a big company.
In this post, I am going to share my experience on how I prepared for this in order to secure a job before finishing my PhD.
I hope my experiences can help other PhD students who are in a similar situation.

# Phase 1: Realization

There is no such a thing as freedom in academia.
As a PhD student your supervisor is technically your manager (meetings every day or week, etc.)
What is even worse, PhD students depend on their supervisors entirely, meaning that they have the result of their work is in their hands.
Even the supervisor has to produce a certain number of papers on a given topic.

PhD salaries for CS students are low compared to the industry.
A salary in the industry easy doubles the salary of a PhD student.
This is a big incentive to leave academia.

PhD students are forced to do extra work that sometimes is not aligned with the research (TA, presentations, supervising Master students etc.)

The amount of impact of a single PhD student is very limited.
This is mainly due to the fact that PhD students have to work alone on their own research, which limits collaboration. 
However, if you work in industry, you can have a much bigger impact.

# Phase 3: Applications

First identify the companies you want to work for.

    Getting the right job could take a long time. Systematic organization is key to keep track of everything that happens during the application process.

# Phase 4: Interviews

> As a PhD student, you don't want to apply to companies that don't respect your research experience.
> If you get some questions such as "How many years of experience do you have?" or "Do you know what pointer is?" that's a red flag, and you should not apply to that company.
> You are not a junior engineer, you will soon become a PhD in Computer Science!
