A PhD has a time constrained endeavour.
For me, it was almost 5 years of full-time research.
After that, I had to decide whether to continue in academia or not. 
I decided to look for a job in industry,[^1] and I am thrilled to share that I have recently accepted a position as a Data Engineer at a prominent Swedish company.
In this blog post, I would like to share my personal experiences and insights from my job-seeking journey, with the hope that it might provide some guidance for fellow PhD students considering a similar path. 
As someone who has gone through the process of securing a job prior to completing a PhD, I understand the challenges and uncertainties you might face, and I hope my story will offer some clarity and inspiration for those about to embark on their own professional journey beyond academia.

# Realization

The decision to remain in academia after obtaining a PhD is often driven by a multitude of factors, one of which is the pressure to maintain a career in the academic world. 
Many PhD students are not fully aware of the vast opportunities that exist beyond the confines of academia, which can make it challenging to consider a career in industry. 
Fortunately, I recognized the potential for growth and success outside of academia and made the conscious decision to explore my options.

Contrary to popular belief, academic freedom is not absolute within the world of academia.
As a PhD student, your supervisor essentially functions as your manager, overseeing your work and progress through regular meetings and updates. This dependence on your supervisor can be stifling, as the fruits of your labor often rest squarely in their hands.
Furthermore, even supervisors themselves are under pressure to produce a specific number of publications within their field, which can create additional tension within the relationship.

    <em>“The greatest leader is not necessarily the one who does the greatest things. He is the one that gets the people to do the greatest things.” ― <cite>Ronald Reagan</cite></em> 
</aside>

Financial considerations also play a significant role in the decision to leave academia. 
PhD salaries for Computer Science students are notably lower than those found in the industry. 
In addition, as a PhD student you may be required to take on additional responsibilities that are not directly related to your research, such as teaching, presentations, and supervising Master's students.
In contrast, a career in industry can easily offer double the salary of a PhD student which much less work overload, making it an attractive alternative.

The potential impact of a PhD student's work within academia can be quite limited and boring sometimes due to the solitary nature of conducting independent research.
This lack of collaboration can hinder the scope and influence of one's work.
In an industry setting, however, you could have the opportunity to work with diverse people and contribute to projects with a much broader impact (if a good choice is made) .
This prospect of having a good life without the stress of research ultimately solidified my decision to transition from academia to a career in industry.

# Preparation

Have a PhD in Computer Science is not enough to get a job in the industry.[^2]
You need to prepare yourself well for the interview process.
For Software Engineering positions, you need to know train the following two skills: 1) solving coding problems under time constraints, and 2) have an understanding of software systems.
The following resources will help you to prepare for the interview process.

## Behavioral Interview

The behavioral interview is the first step in the interview process.
It consists of a series of questions about your past experiences, why you want this particular role you're applying for, and what you know about the company.
It is a way for the company to know you better.
There is not clear way to prepare for this kind of interviews.
The only thing you can do is to be yourself, in a natural way.

## Coding Interview

The coding interview is usually the second step in the interview process.
It consists of a series of coding problems  that you need to solve under time constraints.
Your can find such kind of problems in sites such as [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) or [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).
Some companies do it on-site, while others do it remotely.
The only way to do well in this kind of interviews is to practice a lot.
I would recommend solving at least 30 problems before applying for a job.

I used to participate in [competitive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming) contests [when I was an undergraduate student](../blog/a-starting-guide-to-be-a-good-competitive-programmer.html).
So, I was familiar with this kind of problems and just need a few weeks of preparation to revive my dormant skills.
Still, I solved around 30 problems before applying for a job.
If you're not familiar with this kind of problems, you probably need at least one month to prepare yourself.
Start with easy problems and then move to medium problems (skip hard problems unless your applying to [FANG companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech)).

> Do I need to pay for a course to prepare for the coding interview?
> No, you don't need to pay for a course because there are plenty of free and good resources available online, and you just need to know which ones are the best.

I recommend the following resources available on GitHub:  

- <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) **Knowledge**
- <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [https://github.com/alpha037/data-structures-and-algorithms](https://github.com/alpha037/data-structures-and-algorithms) **Knowledge**

- <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [https://github.com/lee-hen/Algoexpert](https://github.com/lee-hen/Algoexpert) **Training**

## System Design Interview

For software engineering roles, the system design interview is usually the third step in the interview process.
It consists of a series of questions about how to design a software system.
For example, how to design a social network, a search engine, a video streaming service, etc.
The goal is to test your ability to design a system that meets certain requirements.
The requirements are usually not clear, and you need to ask questions to clarify them.
Overall, the main goal if the interviewer is to determine if you have knowledge about how large software systems work and **experience** at working with such as systems.

To be honest, I was not familiar with the design of real-world software systems.
As a researcher, one knows more about algorithms and data structures for small size projects.
So, I needed to learn a lot on this topic.

{% badge /img/badges/designing_data_intensive_applications.png 140 https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/ %}

I recommend preparing using the following two resources:

- <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
- The book "[Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/)" by Martin Kleppmann was very helpful.

In my opinion, communication skills are more important than technical skills in this kind of interviews.
Knowing how to ask questions, how to clarify requirements, and how to explain your design choices is more important than knowing how to design a system.
My years of whiteboarding research ideas helped was very helpful to perform well in this king of interviews.

# Applications

First, I recommend having a clear idea of your desired technical role, and then identify the companies you want to work for.
For researchers, the most common roles are Software Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, and Data Scientist.
Then, you need to find the companies that offer such roles.
A good [career path for researchers](../blog/how-phd-profiles-are-evaluated.html#other-career-paths-for-researchers.html) is to work in an R&D department of a big company.

I use [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com) to check out salaries and reviews of companies.  
Then, I use [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) to find recruiters and people that work in those companies.
I send them a message asking for a referral.
I also apply directly to the job offers that I find interesting told them that.

# Interviews

> As a PhD student, you don't want to apply to companies that don't respect your research experience.
> If you get some questions such as "How many years of experience do you have?" or "Do you know what pointer is?" that's a red flag, and you should not apply to that company.
> You are not a junior engineer, you will soon become a PhD in Computer Science!
