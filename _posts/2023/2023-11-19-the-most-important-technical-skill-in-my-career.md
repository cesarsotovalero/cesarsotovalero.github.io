The main purpose of an Exploratory Data Analysis is to aggregate and visualize basic statistical information.

[//]: # (My writing process:)
[//]: # (I start with 3 questions at the top:)
[//]: # (- What problem am I solving?)
[//]: # (- What are the benefits of solving it?)
[//]: # (- What emotion am I generating?)
[//]: # (From these questions, I create:)
[//]: # (- At least 5 headlines)
[//]: # (- The bullet point summary)
[//]: # (Then I fill in the details.)

A great place to start is at Kaggle i a lot of datasets and a lot of notebooks.

TODO

- EDA is a fundamental skill
- AI struggles with EDA because it needs business context
- EDA is great for impressing managers
- EDA can be applied elsewhere
- For example, I have used EDA for sports analytics, for research, and later at work.
- For example, you can use EDA to analyze the dependencies of projects


ggplot leverages the Grammar of Graphics. 

# About charts

Colors are loaded with symbolisms, shades of greys less so.
Conjugating colors is a very subtle art that is easy to underestimate.

Steps to make plots better:
1. Define a single narrative (message)
2. Choose the right chart type
3. Simplify to avoid information overload (e.g., no more than 3 colors)
4. Use the caption to synthesize the message, not the chart itself. 
5. Check for message bias using a third party.
