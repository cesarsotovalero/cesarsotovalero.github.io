The year was 2013. 
I was a young graduated from Computer Science working at my former university.
I discovered academic research. 
I started reading papers and doing my own research project.
I quickly realized that of something that all the papers have in common: data.
Data is necessary to validate the research hypothesis.
So I started learning about Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
It allowed me to understand the dataset by doing visualizations, find patterns, and take decisions.
EDA is a fundamental skill for any job that involves decision-making.
Now, 12 years later, I still use EDA.
It's the most important technical skill in my career. 
In this article, I explain to you why.

# The Power EDA

The main purpose of an Exploratory Data Analysis is to aggregate and visualize basic statistical information.
A great place to start is at Kaggle i a lot of datasets and a lot of notebooks.

## In Academia

Opportunity Booster.

I followed the latest papers published in the [Journal of Statistical Software](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index) and the [Journal of Machine Learning Research](https://www.jmlr.org/).

## In Industry

TODO

- EDA is a fundamental skill
- AI struggles with EDA because it needs business context
- EDA is great for impressing managers
- EDA can be applied elsewhere
- For example, I have used EDA for sports analytics, for research, and later at work.
- For example, you can use EDA to analyze the dependencies of projects

You can combine the data analysis with front-end development to create interactive dashboards.
For example, it's possible to create a dashboard to visualize the dependencies of a project.


# The Craft of EDA

## Facts

## Narratives

> I was sitting in the library and going through recent journal articles. To everyoneâ€™s surprise, Donald Knuth walks in. I think he wants some quiet after debugging his latest volume of "The Art of Computer Programming" ðŸ˜‚

> I can now say, the average number of citations of all researchers in the library, including myself, are now in thousands.

> Perfect example of how to lie with statistics. Be careful while using average, it can be mean to you ðŸ˜†

> Outliers can wreck your model. As many software development tools with automated programming are evolving fast, we have to understand that thorough literature review is still the best precautionary academic task.

## Aesthetics

## Tools

Use vector graphics for publication-quality plots.

It's about the details.

ggplot leverages the Grammar of Graphics.

Colors are loaded with symbolisms, shades of greys less so.
Conjugating colors is a very subtle art that is easy to underestimate.

Steps to make plots better:
1. Define a single narrative (message)
2. Choose the right chart type
3. Simplify to avoid information overload (e.g., no more than 3 colors)
4. Use the caption to synthesize the message, not the chart itself. 
5. Check for message bias using a third party.

Do the last retouches in a vector graphics editor (e.g., Inkscape).
