# Why?

Simply using a pair of keys to encrypt/decrypt and sign/verify some piece of data does not guarantee that the information came from a specific user. 
Ultimately, a pair of keys is not tied to a person or a system. 
To solve this problem, an infrastructure is required in order to bind these two aspects together.

**Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)** is a set of entities, with distinct roles, responsible for managing _digital certificates_. 
This includes their _generation_, _storage_, _distribution_, and _revocation_.
These certificates can then be used to authenticate a user, or a machine, to a service. 
Simply, a user can provide his public key to a **Certificate Authority (CA)** to prove his identity to that authority, e.g., by physically going to an office, which will then create a certificate containing the identity of the user and the public key. 
This, guarantees that the public key (or certificate) distributed to the web is bound to a specific person or system.

# Encryption

## Symmetric Encryption

%%{init: {'theme':'base'}}%%
flowchart TB;

{% endmermaid %}

The `KEY` node represents the symmetric key, and arrows are drawn from this node to both the encryption and decryption processes to emphasize that the same key is used in both steps. This illustrates that the encryption and decryption keys are identical in symmetric encryption.


- The same key is used by sender and receiver
- Fast and (probably) secure
- Confidentiality and integrity
- Availability is a problem, since establishing trust (key distribution) is
  complicated

## Asymmetric Encryption

- Based on mathematical problems that are hard to reverse:
  - Factorization - RSA (Rivest‚ÄìShamir‚ÄìAdleman)
  - Discrete logarithm - DSA (Diffie-Hellman)
  - Elliptic curve - ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)

- The sender uses the receiver‚Äôs public key, and the receiver (with the private key) is the only one that can read the message.
- Slower and (maybe) less secure than symmetric encryption.

# Signing

Reversing asymmetric encryption.

- What happens if we encrypt with the private key?
‚Ä¢ Everyone can decrypt, using the public key
‚Ä¢ We know who encrypted the document
‚Ä¢ Usually performed on a hash of a message (since the signature is not confidential)
‚Ä¢ This is called signing

# Certificates

How do we distribute public keys?

- A certificate is a signed public key (with some additional information).
- Certificates are stored with their signing certificates in X.509 files.
- A keystore (such as Public Key Cryptography Standard 12 - PKCS 12) is commonly used to bundle a private key together with an X.509 certificate.

So where is the infrastructure?
 
- A certificate is signed (self-signed or by another certificate)
- A certificate with the purpose of signing is called a certificate authority (CA)
- Trusting the CA will allow you to trust the certificates issued by it
- Confidentiality, integrity and availability!

What happens if my private key is compromised?

- The certificate authority can revoke a certificate
- But how do I know that a certificate has been revoked?
- The certificate tells the verifier where to look!
- Certificate revokation lists (CRLs) are fetched and cached for some time
- Online certificate status protocol (OCSP) queries every time a certificate is verified

# Example: HTTPS

Billions of people use https everyday.
I would say, this is the most fundamental building block of modern securit

How does HTTPS work?

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP.) HTTPS transmits encrypted data using Transport Layer Security (TLS.) If the data is hijacked online, all the hijacker gets is binary code.

How is the data encrypted and decrypted?

Step 1 - The client (browser) and the server establish a TCP connection.

Step 2 - The client sends a ‚Äúclient hello‚Äù to the server. The message contains a set of necessary encryption algorithms (cipher suites) and the latest TLS version it can support. The server responds with a ‚Äúserver hello‚Äù so the browser knows whether it can support the algorithms and TLS version.

The server then sends the SSL certificate to the client. The certificate contains the public key, host name, expiry dates, etc. The client validates the certificate.

Step 3 - After validating the SSL certificate, the client generates a session key and encrypts it using the public key. The server receives the encrypted session key and decrypts it with the private key.

Step 4 - Now that both the client and the server hold the same session key (symmetric encryption), the encrypted data is transmitted in a secure bi-directional channel.

Why does HTTPS switch to symmetric encryption during data transmission? There are two main reasons:

1. Security: The asymmetric encryption goes only one way. This means that if the server tries to send the encrypted data back to the client, anyone can decrypt the data using the public key.

2. Server resources: The asymmetric encryption adds quite a lot of mathematical overhead. It is not suitable for data transmissions in long sessions.

Over to you: how much performance overhead does HTTPS add, compared to HTTP?
