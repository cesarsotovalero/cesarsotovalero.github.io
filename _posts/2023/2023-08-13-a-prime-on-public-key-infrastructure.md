Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) plays a crucial role in ensuring secure electronic information transfer for various network activities such as e-commerce, internet banking, and confidential email. It is particularly essential when simple passwords are insufficient for authentication, requiring stronger proof of identity for secure communication. In essence, PKI binds public keys with the identities of entities, like individuals and organizations, through a process of registration and issuance of digital certificates provided by Certificate Authority (CA). The CA is responsible for digitally signing and publishing the public keys, ensuring the trustworthiness of the binding. In this article, I It discuss the critical role of PKI in ensuring the authenticity and security of digital transactions and communication on the internet.

# The Problem With Trust

From the ancient times, people have tried to find ways to communicate securely.
The problem is that we need to trust the entity that delivers the message, and that the content of message itself is not modified. 

In essence, there are two fundamental problems to solve to achieve security in communication:
 
- **Confidentiality:** Only the intended recipient should be able to read the message.
- **Integrity:** The message should not be modified by a third party.





# Encryption

## Symmetric Encryption

[//]: # (see https://mermaid-js.github.io)
{% mermaid %}
%%{init: {'theme':'base'}}%%
flowchart TB;
U(["üë© User"]) --> |"üìí Plaintext"| C["Encryption Process"]
KEY["üîë Symmetric Key"]
KEY --> C
C --> K["üîí Ciphertext"]
K --> F["Decryption Process"]
KEY --> F
F --> G["üìí Plaintext"]
{% endmermaid %}

The `KEY` node represents the symmetric key, and arrows are drawn from this node to both the encryption and decryption processes to emphasize that the same key is used in both steps. This illustrates that the encryption and decryption keys are identical in symmetric encryption.

- The same key is used by sender and receiver
- Fast and (probably) secure
- Confidentiality and integrity
- Availability is a problem, since establishing trust (key distribution) is
  complicated

## Asymmetric Encryption

- Based on mathematical problems that are hard to reverse:
  - Factorization - RSA (Rivest‚ÄìShamir‚ÄìAdleman)
  - Discrete logarithm - DSA (Diffie-Hellman)
  - Elliptic curve - ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)

- The sender uses the receiver‚Äôs public key, and the receiver (with the private key) is the only one that can read the message.
- Slower and (maybe) less secure than symmetric encryption.

# Signing

Reversing asymmetric encryption.

- What happens if we encrypt with the private key?
‚Ä¢ Everyone can decrypt, using the public key
‚Ä¢ We know who encrypted the document
‚Ä¢ Usually performed on a hash of a message (since the signature is not confidential)
‚Ä¢ This is called signing

# Certificates

Simply using a pair of keys to encrypt/decrypt and sign/verify some piece of data does not guarantee that the information came from a specific user.

Ultimately, a pair of keys is not tied to a person or a system.
To solve this problem, an infrastructure is required in order to bind these two aspects together.

**Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)** is a set of entities, with distinct roles, responsible for managing _digital certificates_.
This includes their _generation_, _storage_, _distribution_, and _revocation_.
These certificates can then be used to authenticate a user, or a machine, to a service.
Simply, a user can provide his public key to a **Certificate Authority (CA)** to prove his identity to that authority, e.g., by physically going to an office, which will then create a certificate containing the identity of the user and the public key.
This, guarantees that the public key (or certificate) distributed to the web is bound to a specific person or system.

- Confidentiality ‚Äì our interactions are not read by a third party
- Integrity ‚Äì our interactions are not modified by a third party (protection from imposters)
- Availability ‚Äì our interactions are not blocked by a third party

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate

How do we distribute public keys?

- A certificate is a signed public key (with some additional information).
- Certificates are stored with their signing certificates in X.509 files.
- A keystore (such as Public Key Cryptography Standard 12 - PKCS 12) is commonly used to bundle a private key together with an X.509 certificate.

So where is the infrastructure?
 
- A certificate is signed (self-signed or by another certificate)
- A certificate with the purpose of signing is called a certificate authority (CA)
- Trusting the CA will allow you to trust the certificates issued by it
- Confidentiality, integrity and availability!

What happens if my private key is compromised?

- The certificate authority can revoke a certificate
- But how do I know that a certificate has been revoked?
- The certificate tells the verifier where to look!
- Certificate revokation lists (CRLs) are fetched and cached for some time
- Online certificate status protocol (OCSP) queries every time a certificate is verified

# Web of Trust

In the "web of trust" scheme, where individuals vouch for each other's keys.

# Descentralized PKI

Additionally, decentralized PKI (DPKI) eliminates reliance on centralized authorities by allowing each entity to serve as its own root authority.

# Example: HTTPS

Billions of people use the [Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) every day.
HTTPS is a protocol that allows secure communication between a client and a server.
I would say, this is the most fundamental building block of the internet.

HTTPS uses encryption to protect the privacy and integrity of the data being transmitted.
It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks, and the bidirectional block cipher encryption of communications between a client and server protects the communications against eavesdropping and tampering.
If the data is hijacked online, all the hijacker gets is binary code.

## How does HTTPS work?

HTTPS transmits encrypted data using [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security).
The authentication aspect of HTTPS requires a trusted third-party to sign server-side digital certificates.

Here is how the transmitted data is encrypted and decrypted:

1. First, the client (browser) and the server establish a TCP connection.

2. The client sends a ‚Äú_first client message_‚Äù to the server containing a set of  encryption algorithms (or cipher suites) which indicates the latest TLS version it can support.
 
3. The server responds with a ‚Äú_first server message_‚Äù so the browser knows whether it can support the algorithms and TLS version.

4. The server then sends the SSL certificate to the client containing the public key, host name, expiry dates, etc. 

5. After validating the SSL certificate, the client generates a session key and encrypts it using the public key.

6. The server receives the encrypted session key and decrypts it with the private key.

7. Now that both the client and the server hold the same session key (symmetric encryption), the encrypted data is transmitted in a secure bi-directional channel.

There are two main reasons of why HTTPS switches to symmetric encryption during data transmission:

1. **Security:** The asymmetric encryption goes only one way. This means that if the server tries to send the encrypted data back to the client, anyone can decrypt the data using the public key.

2. **Server resources:** The asymmetric encryption adds quite a lot of mathematical overhead. It is not suitable for data transmissions in long sessions.
