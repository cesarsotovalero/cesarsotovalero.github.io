Once upon a long time, software was a strange thing.
Even stranger was the people who created it.
Programmers.
Or weren't them scientists?
I'm too young to know exactly.
Anyway, they were a strange breed. 
Mathematicians, physicists, or pure engineers who learned programming languages to solve their practical problems.
These people had advanced reasoning skills.
They understood complex systems, and were able to implement QuickSort in 10 minutes or less.

But that was a long time ago.
Nowadays, software is everywhere.
It's like salt for the food. 
In every industry, in every company, in every home, software is a necessary ingredient.
So the crew of programmers has grown.
But the world had not enough mathematicians, or engineers, to satisfy the demand for programmers.
And as with any other resource, the higher the supply, the less the quality.

In the last two decades, a new class of programmers has taken over the industry.
Software developers!
They don't need to understand Calculus anymore to get a decent job offer.
Indeed, they don't even need to know how a computer actually works.
It's enough to master a particular framework, a library, or even a single digital tool.
And bang! 
The wheel of production goes on.
The software industry is ready to go.

But the panorama is changing in the last years.
What if I tell you that you don't even need to know how code anymore?
Yes, you don't.
Because now you can use computers to write code for you.
The new era of AI has come to us developers.

# Show Me the Prompt!

Looks like coding has become very cheap thanks to AI and LLMs.
With time, every line of code will decrease its price.
Given a prompt, these language models generate a lot of text that is makes sense.
And it looks like code is the easiest form of text representation for them.
In other words, AI can write reasonably good code faster than humans.

Still, there is a problem.
The seed to fuel the machine.
The prompts!
We still need humans to write them.
So a new class of programmers has emerged.
The ones who understand how to write prompts to solve coding problems.
They are called prompters.

The prompter daily task is to ask questions.
They are like Socrates, or a 5-year-old child (depending on how much you estimate the job).
So it's all about formulating questions:
"I got the following log message, how to fix the problem?," 
"I have a list of items, write an algorithm to sort them?,"
"My boss is annoying me, what should I do?."
And then is all about copying and pasting the AI's response in the right place (often called production).

Does prompting looks familiar to you?
Yes, it's the exact same thing we used to do every day when searching Google and looking at QAs on StackOverflow.
But now we can get the answer faster.
Even better, now it looks like we can get the answer without even knowing how to ask the question!
AIs are getting better than us at understanding our own problems.

This is the end of software engineering as we know it.
The impact in the workforce is going to be huge.
The wave of public skepticism about the future of Computer Science is growing.
And the number of people who are ~~kicked out from~~ leaving the industry is increasing.

But don't worry.
There is still hope.
We still have a few years to adapt and improve.
And maybe we can all keep our jobs after all.
I'm talking about becoming successfull prompters, of course.

And we'll prommpt with our voice, with images, with videos, with text, with code, with everything.
Not only to solve coding problems, but to solve any problem.
Websites will feature their own AI system, tuned specifilly for their platform.
So in the era of data as a gold, prompters are the new gold miners.

# The Prompter Manifesto

> “We, the prompters, are the new breed of programmers.
> We are the ones who understand how to write prompts to make AI solve ~~our~~ problems.
> We take all the credit from the answers.
> We take paychecks too.
>
> We create value through innovative ideas.
> We have regular meetings to brainstorm new ~~prompts~~ ideas. 
> We break down complex problems intro promptable smaller components.
> We don't write bugs, AI does.
>
> We encourage a culture of lifelong prompting and skill enhancement.
> We share our prompts with the community.
> We have daily prompt revisions where we blame AI for not understanding our problems.
> 
> We prompted an AI to help us write this manifesto.
> We will keep improving it.
> We will prompt a future AI to write it better.”

# The Successful Prompter

The successful understands how AI actually works.
They can tweak the prompt to get the best results.

Prompts:

1. I want to learn `X`. Can you **use the Pareto Principle**, which identifies the 20% of the topic that will yield 80% of the desired results, to create a focused learning plan for me?
2. Create a **study schedule** for all of the above in an appropriate number of weeks. I can study for `X` hours every Tuesday and Thursday. Please include time for revision and testing.
3. Suggest various learning resources (like books, videos, podcasts, interactive exercises) for the above topics that cater to different learning styles to me.
4. I'm a beginner interested in learning how to create games in Unity. To do this, I need to know how to code in C#. Can you give me some beginner video game projects I could work on to help strengthen my C# coding skills?
5. Explain [topic] to me in the simplest terms possible as if I were a complete beginner (or as if I was a 5-year-old).
6. Guide me through a visualization exercise to help me internalize the term opportunity cost and imagine myself successfully applying it to a real-life situation.
7. I want you to act as a Socrates and use the Socratic method to help me improve my critical thinking, logic, and reasoning skills. Your task is to ask open-ended questions to the statement I make, and after I provide a response, give me constructive feedback to each response before you ask the next question.
