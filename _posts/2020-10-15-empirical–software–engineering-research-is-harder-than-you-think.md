I have learnt it the hard way.


Journals like Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE) or conferences such as Mining Software Repositories (MSR) are ranking high in the

What is empirical software engineering?

What a typical empirical software engineering paper looks like?

- hypothesis proposal (is it useful? is it novel?)
- data collection (which tools are already available?)
- hypothesis validation (design of the experiments, protocols)
- interpretation of the results and discussion
- generation of a conclusion (are the results valuable knowledge to researchers and practitioners?)

How does it compares with other research fields?


For example, in ML research, the hypothesis is either to propose a new algorithm or technique that outperforms
