Documentation\n2. Environment setup and maintenance\n3. Writing and maintaining tests\n4. Task tracking and backlog management\n5. Security and compliance\n\nThe takeaway: \n\nThere are huge opportunities to create great AI products for developers beyond coding tools.",

He presented unique insights based on years of research creating scientific benchmarks for measuring AI‚Äôs intelligence.\n\nMy takeaway:\n\n\"As long as we can easily come out with tasks that are easy for humans, but that AI can‚Äôt figure out, we don‚Äôt have AGI yet.\"\n\nMy notes:\n\nüîπ Fluid intelligence:\n‚§∑¬†It doesn‚Äôt emerge from pretraining and scaling GPT models.\n\nüîπ Test-Time Adaptation (TTA):\n‚§∑¬†It has dramatically improved model capabilities, but it‚Äôs still not AGI.\n\nüîπ What is intelligence, anyway? \n‚§∑¬†Intelligence is a process, not to be confused with \"skill\", which is the output of that process. So, intelligence is the ability to deal with new situations.\n\nüîπ What is AGI, then?\n‚§∑¬†We shouldn‚Äôt define AGI as a system that can perform 80% of economically valuable tasks. Instead, true AGI would be a system that can learn new skills efficiently and solve previously unseen problems.\n\nIn the end, Collet shares his current work on building a new kind of AI model capable of extrapolating NEW solutions using a ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù of previously discovered abstractions.\n\nIn his view, the ultimate goal of AGI isn‚Äôt automation. It‚Äôs to accelerate scientific progress.\n\nOverall, a remarkable talk by a brilliant scientist.\n\n* I personally don‚Äôt believe Collet's suite of interactive video games is the best way for determining whether we've reached AGI.\n\nMy favorite slide üëá",

For comparison, $100M is roughly twice NBA superstar LeBron James‚Äôs base salary in 2025.\n\nBut...\n\n‚Üí¬†How much is that price tag in the grand scheme of things?\n‚Üí¬†How does anyone could measure the true value of a human brain?\n\nAs a PhD graduate, let me share 5 thoughts on this:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ We now have incredibly powerful AI models, but building them depends on a very small circle of top-tier minds (now in their 30s) who were working in obscure, undervalued research areas just a few years ago.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Meta isn‚Äôt simply paying for researchers, it‚Äôs paying for battle-tested, experimental experience in building and deploying LLMs at scale.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ For Meta and other companies of similar size, $100M is just a fraction of what‚Äôs invested in AI infrastructure, such as GPU data centers.\n\n4Ô∏è‚É£ We still don‚Äôt know whether this talent race will drive new breakthroughs or merely concentrate intellectual power in a few corporate labs.\n\n5Ô∏è‚É£ This isn‚Äôt good news for the traditional academic system. PhD graduates deserve high pay, top talent eill flood into Big Tech, chasing billions instead of papers and teaching.\n\nEither way, what a time to be fitting tensors and orchestrating agents! \n\nI wish I had done my PhD in NLP a decade ago :/\n\nOnce again, the future proves unpredictable üîÆ",

Even when discussing limitations, he keeps the vibe optimistic.\n\nBelow is a more detailed breakdown of his flow ‚Üì\n\nIntro:\n‚Ä¢ Begins with enthusiasm and gratitude for being there.\n‚Ä¢ Remarks on the title and explains why the topic matters.\n‚Ä¢ Frames the big question: Why is software changing so fast?\n‚Ä¢ Provides a historical perspective: Software 1.0 ‚Üí 2.0 ‚Üí 3.0.\n‚Ä¢ Uses concrete examples to highlight his key observation.\n\nPart 1: Software Evolution\n‚Ä¢ Quotes Andrew Ng: AI is the new electricity.\n‚Ä¢ Explains the analogy with real-life examples (e.g., factories ‚Üí software).\n‚Ä¢ Adds his twist: \"LLMs are like a new OS.\"\n‚Ä¢ Introduces a counterintuitive idea: We have a new magical computer helping us boil eggs.\n‚Ä¢ Summarizes Part 1 with bullet points.\n\nPart 2: The Psychology of LLMs\n‚Ä¢ Dives a bit into the internals of LLMs (transformers).\n‚Ä¢ Acknowledges their current limitations.\n‚Ä¢ Recommends sci-fi movies as a gift to the audience.\n‚Ä¢ Summarizes Part 2 with images.\n\nPart 3: New Opportunities\n‚Ä¢ Offers a new abstraction: LLMs as the GUIs for machine intelligence.\n‚Ä¢ Gives real examples of current successes (e.g., Cursor).\n‚Ä¢ Poses the big question: What will future apps look like?\n‚Ä¢ Weaves analogies and personal stories (how he uses LLMs, how he ‚Äúkeeps AI on a leash,‚Äù his first Waymo ride, etc).\n‚Ä¢ Shows an emotional video of kids vibe coding (going emotional with a hopeful vision).\n‚Ä¢ Ends Part 3 with his vibe-coded app experiments and areas still unexplored (this opens up for the next final section)\n\nPart 4: Building for Agents\n‚Ä¢ Makes a bold prediction: We‚Äôre entering a new era of digital ‚Äúagents.‚Äù\n‚Ä¢ Imagines future human‚ÄìAI interaction.\n‚Ä¢ Introduces upcoming tools and possibilities.\n\nFinal Summary:\n‚Ä¢ Displays a collage of key slides tying everything together into a single storyline.\n\nOverall, an extremely well-packaged talk ‚ú®\nShould we try to replicate this framework?",

Power through the fatigue.\n\nAll I needed, I thought, was ‚Äújust one more research paper,‚Äù ‚Äújust one more OSS project,‚Äù ‚Äújust one more thing to prove to myself,‚Äù and so on‚Ä¶\n\nThis kind of self-pressure often drained me, but I was younger and could afford the late nights.\n\nToday, I need to be more mindful of my capacity.\n\nI‚Äôve learned that willpower isn‚Äôt an infinite resource, and that the best long-term strategy is to dose it wisely.\n\nMotivation doesn‚Äôt fail because we‚Äôre weak. It fails because it runs out. \n\nJust like a muscle, our willpower gets depleted after use, and pretending it doesn‚Äôt only makes the crash harder.\n\nAnd if you feel like me, most of the time the problem isn‚Äôt actually depletion, it‚Äôs refusing to refuel.\n\nEnergy is a limited resource that can easily be drained.\n\nLooking into it, I found a 2008 study that showed people who rested just 10 minutes between demanding tasks recovered completely, while others stayed depleted.\n\nSo the next time you can‚Äôt focus, procrastinate, or lose control, don‚Äôt shame yourself. \n\nYour tank could be empty. What you need isn‚Äôt more discipline. You need a break that actually refuels you.\n\nRelaxing isn‚Äôt the same as cheering up. It‚Äôs not about just ‚Äúfeeling good‚Äù, it‚Äôs about slowing down. \n\nStop thinking\nNo cellphone\nQuiet\nStillness\nDoing nothing on purpose\n\nSo, I‚Äôve stopped blaming myself when I‚Äôm drained.\n\nEvery time I‚Äôm exhausted, I tell myself:¬†‚ÄúRunning on empty doesn‚Äôt make you strong, it actually makes you stuck.‚Äù\n\nYou‚Äôll never hit rock bottom again if you learn to pause before the crash üßò",

It‚Äôs that we still don‚Äôt know when (or where) it will.\n\nIn 2023, researchers from Harvard University, MIT Professional Education, The Wharton School, and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) ran experiments with 758 consultants using GPT‚Äë4 and identified an invisible boundary.\n\nThey called it the \"Jagged Frontier\". The inability of LLMs to deal the same way with tasks with the same level of complexity for a human. \n\nWhat did they found?\n\nWhen tasks matched GPT‚Äë4‚Äôs strengths:\n‚úÖ +40% in quality, +25% faster execution, +12% more output\n\nBut when tasks didn‚Äôt:\n‚ùå A 19% drop in efficiency \n\nFair enough :/ But what's the real issue?\n\nThe problem is that most people couldn‚Äôt tell when they‚Äôd crossed the line:\n\nüëâ ‚ÄúOn some tasks AI is immensely powerful, and on others it fails completely or subtly. And unless you use AI a lot, you won‚Äôt know which is which.‚Äù\n\nOkay, that was 2 years ago. Today‚Ä¶\n\nAI systems are adapting: adding guardrails, evals, decision triggers, and human oversight.\n\nThe frontier is beginning to blur, not because LLMs are flawless, but because our systems for working with them are getting better.\n\nWe‚Äôre entering a new agentic phase by:\n\n‚úì Mapping workflows ‚Üí¬†e.g., aligning AI strengths with task complexity\n‚úì Building guardrails ‚Üí¬†e.g., audit trails, explainable outputs, confidence thresholds\n‚úì Upskilling humans ‚Üí¬†e.g., at prompt design, uncertainty detection, human-in-the-loop orchestration\n\nI believe there is great potential in having models that know when to pause, ask, and let humans decide, completely flattering the line. \n\nAsk yourself:\nWhere are the jagged edges in your current workflow?\n\nTbh, it's getting harder for me to figure this one out üòÑ",

        "text": "Attended my first Google Cloud Summit Nordics at Avicii Arena in Stockholm, this time was all about ü§ñ ‚à© ‚òÅÔ∏è. Below are my thoughts from what I saw there ‚Üì\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ The cloud giants have gone all-in on AI.\n\nRapid customer acquisition and marketing are often high priorities in the early stages of disruptive technologies. The race is on. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are aggressively positioning their clouds as AI-first platforms. These cloud providers have the competitive advantage of already having the necessary infrastructure to create AI-native cloud services. For them, it‚Äôs a numbers game üí∏\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Yet, no mind-blowing innovation on the sight.\n\nWith Gemini 2.5 Pro, one can write JavaScript frontend, Java backend, and Terraform IaC in natural language without leaving the platform. It can now feed all your company data into its context window and answer questions about it. But we already knew it would be just a matter of time before this happened. The question is: what else? Personally, I would like to see new use cases. For example, a new type of AI-powered product integrated in a way that I could really use in my daily life, beyond the well-known chatbot-styled UI (maybe an AI-native hardware device would be interesting) üïπÔ∏è\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ For devs, AI is a double-edged productivity boost. \n\nOn-cloud AI code assistants will change how we create and deploy apps. There‚Äôs truly no going back to handwriting code from scratch anymore. I wonder if there is any chance for local AI-powered IDEs when these cloud providers have all the context integrated... I don‚Äôt know, but for the time being, AI is being sold as the perfect way to ‚Äúexperiment quickly, build agentic experiences, shift down, use AI assistance, and become wildly more productive,‚Äù hmm üôÑ \n\nMy last takeaway: Move faster. Build smarter. Offload to an AI the grunt work. Ship on the cloud like never before. Tomorrow, we don‚Äôt know.\n\nOverall, a well-organized and worthwhile event to attend.\n\nPS. When it comes to good food and entertainment, Google truly knows how to deliver üòé",

        "text": "Yesterday, I participated in the Google Cloud AI Hackathon, held to celebrate the launch of its cloud region in Sweden. I tried vibe-coding a Firebase app without writing a single LoC myself. Below are 7 thoughts that crossed my mind during the day ‚Üì\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Everyone should learn how to use AI to build software. I mean EVERYONE, no excuses. If you haven‚Äôt tried yet‚Ä¶ what are you waiting for?\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ The best (and probably only) way to understand AI‚Äôs impact on software development is by playing with it and trying as many tools as you can. I guess you already know the benefits, limits, and ideal use cases of the most popular ones‚Ä¶ do you?\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Having access to an AI-driven cloud ecosystem speeds things up a lot. You can build a full working prototype from (clear) idea to deployment in a few hours just by prompting Gemini 2.5. It is capable of orchestrating the cloud-native components like a boss! This makes me wonder... will app development outside agentic private clouds soon feel obsolete?\n\n4Ô∏è‚É£ Most of the participants were quite young. I‚Äôd estimate the average age was under 30, and some winners weren‚Äôt even developers. Are more seasoned professional devs missing the AI r/evolution?\n\n5Ô∏è‚É£ Seeing these tools in action, and how insanely fast you can build with them, made me question everything. Do traditional dev practices, like SCRUM, do they even make sense anymore? Can we truly be ‚ÄúAI native‚Äù if we keep using workflows designed to harness lazy humans?\n\n6Ô∏è‚É£ One of the biggest mindset shifts I had was this: you don‚Äôt need to know everything to start building. With the right AI tools, you can learn while doing. Skipping hours of tutorials and docs. Does it even make sense to read tutorials anymore?\n\n7Ô∏è‚É£ Hackathons are such a great way to level up, connect with energetic folks, and get a front-row seat to the future. Seems like the new best way to get people involved, so there's a big opportunity there for everyone: Hackathons are the Bootcamps v2.0! \n\nAnyway, I‚Äôm thrilled #Sweden just became a Google Cloud hub in the Nordics! üá∏üá™üöÄ‚òÅÔ∏è",

Developers worldwide contribute to US-owned repos. In contrast, the EU gets far fewer inbound contributions than it sends out.\n\nüì§ Outbound ‚Üí Who Gives?\n\nThe EU leads in outbound activity. EU devs contribute heavily to projects outside the region. The US contributes far less by comparison.\n\n‚öñÔ∏è The imbalance is huge, meaning:\n\n‚Ü≥¬†OSS gravity (forks, issues, PRs, and visibility) pulls toward the US, whereas EU projects don‚Äôt attract the same global attention.\n‚Ü≥¬†The EU is a code contributor, not a code destination.\n‚Ü≥¬†For the US, this leads to better sustainability, faster innovation, and more influence. \n‚Ü≥¬†For the EU, it‚Äôs a strategic vulnerability, relying on OSS platforms it doesn‚Äôt control.\n‚Ü≥¬†Key libraries and infrastructure are US-based, eroding EU digital sovereignty.\n‚Ü≥¬†EU devs are working for free on US projects, efforts without royalties.\n\nThis tech power imbalance is worth fixing.\n\nüéØ Here‚Äôre three ways to start changing it:\n\n1. The EU should invest more on local OSS (tools, libraries, and specially AI frameworks).\n2. The EU should host and protect key projects within EU jurisdictions.\n3. The EU should create OSS alliances and Foundations, building contributor communities across EU countries. \n\nOn my view, this obviously isn‚Äôt a lack of talent.

THat spontaneous 20 min conversation evolved into a long term research collaboration. We ended up writing a few papers together!\n\nIt's amazing how a genuine request for someone's insights can spark collaboration, innovation, and even friendships.\n\nNever underestimate the power of simply reaching out.\n\nGive it a try! üëã\n\nP.S.

How could anyone maintain this stuff?‚Äù\n\nIf you‚Äôve been into software long enough, I‚Äôm 100% sure you‚Äôve had this kind of feeling.\n\nBut over time, I‚Äôve learned something:\n\n‚Ü≥ When really complex systems work for real customers, even if they work imperfectly, that‚Äôs not something to take lightly.\n\nThe very fact that it has worked and survived the test of time is a huge achievement!\n\nBecause complex systems are always messy from the inside out.\n\nSIDE NOTE: You know what I mean, the complexity of software is such a fascinating thing, isn‚Äôt it? üòÅ\n\nThis complexity is the price we pay for solving real problems at scale.\n\nThere‚Äôs no way to escape from it.\n\nWe don‚Äôt eliminate complexity, we just move it around and hide it with abstractions. \n\nThat‚Äôs why I hesitate before touching legacy code that has quietly done its job for years.\n\nNow I only change old, battle-proven code when I absolutely must. Seriously.\n\nIf you're in doubt, remember Chesterton‚Äôs Fence: \n\n‚Ü≥ ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tear down a fence until you understand why it was built.‚Äù\n\nIn other words: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt change what you don‚Äôt understand!‚Äù\n\nI know it's hard this days, with #AI tools, it‚Äôs easier than ever to refactor or rewrite code. The bar to start making changes has lowered down significantly. But there‚Äôs a danger in how quickly we forget why something exists. For example, AI doesn‚Äôt know that a function was built around a legal constraint, a performance hack, or a hard-learned production failure.\n\nMany disasters in software don‚Äôt come from bad intentions. They come from lack of context and/or ignoring history.\n\nNew leaders often arrive, find things ‚Äúuseless‚Äù or ‚Äúbroken,‚Äù and want to delete or change them without appreciating the journey it took other devs to get there.\n\nSo when entering into a new codebase, respect wildlife like a nice guest in your neighbor's house. Because we won‚Äôt be able to fully grasp the intricacies of an ecosystem at the first glance, and that‚Äôs why we tread lightly.\n\nLet me said it again, we should stop pretending complexity can be removed. I've seen so many failed attempts into this direction... I can't count.\n\nLet‚Äôs accept complexity, that‚Äôs all. \n\nGood engineers make sure they understand the past before trying to mess around with the present.\n\nLet‚Äôs respect wildlife, for our own survival! üêü",

And unlike typing, you can‚Äôt easily go back and edit your words when speaking. That makes natural language interactions slow, error-prone, and frustrating.\n\n‚Üí¬†It‚Äôs limited because it's lossy and ambiguous. Structured commands are clear. Language is fuzzy. You say one thing, the machine hears another. And you enter a cycle of clarifications.\n\n‚Üí¬†It‚Äôs inconvenient because saying ‚ÄúOpen a new tab‚Äù out loud when ‚åòT does it instantly is nonsense. Not to mention that this doesn't work in public spaces. \n\nSo no, #LLMs won‚Äôt replace the mouse and keyboard.\nIt doesn't matter how good the models will get.\n\nWhen we‚Äôll ditch them?\nIf you ask me, I think that'll happen when #AI can finally read our thoughts.\n\nBut that‚Äôs another story.\n\nFor now, I‚Äôll keep enjoying the satisfying clack clack of my hand-modded mechanical keyboard ‚å®Ô∏è",

        "text": "Let me tell you a quick story about programming, chess, and what's been wrong with coding interviews for decades:\n\nIn my 1st year of grad school, I heard about programming contests. They sounded exciting, but I didn‚Äôt solved any problem (I didn't know how to code in 2009).\n\nBy 2nd year, I jumped in, competed in a local ACM-ICPC tournament and got hooked.\n\nNext year, I was solving problem after problem on online judges (got 1,000+ correct submissions) and went to the regionals. It felt like leveling up in a video game.\n\nBut something changed.\n\nThe deeper I went, the more I realized: this wasn‚Äôt fun anymore. It was like ches: to really excel, you have to dedicate your life to it (I love chess, btw). \n\nThat killed the joy.\n\nSo I stepped away.\n\nYears later, I entered the job market, and boom! Coding interviews (especially in big tech) were all about solving those kinds of ADA problems live, under extreme pressure.\n\nIt felt familiar. Too familiar‚Ä¶\n\nBut in this case there's a huge problem:\n\nSolving algorithm puzzles in 45 mins has nothing to do with writing clean, maintainable software in the real world.\n\nWorse, the system is really broken:\n\n‚Ü≥ It rewards people who‚Äôve memorized patterns, not those who solve real problems.\n‚Ü≥ It filters out brilliant engineers who haven‚Äôt ‚ÄúLeetcoded enough.‚Äù\n‚Ü≥ It creates a test that‚Äôs easy to fail.\n\nI understand that this test style is scalable, but I've seen senior engineers with PhDs and successful OSS projects spending weeks practicing LeetCode problems just to get past the first interview screen.\n\nPutting that much energy into riddles wasn‚Äôt that bad 20 years ago. But the world has changed a lot since then.\n\nToday‚Äôs #LLMs can solve most ACM-ICPC problems in seconds.\n\nI don't really see how this could be a good way to test the value of professionals.\n\nToday I read about undetectable apps that feeds GPT-powered answers during LeetCode-style online interviews, like the one created by Roy Lee.\n\nSo the system will collapse under its own weight (at least for its online mode). But honestly... I'm happy about it.\n\nIt‚Äôs finally time to kill programming-contest-style interviews for good.\n\nSo what should we do instead?\n\nHere are some alternatives that I believe actually reflect real skills:\n\n‚Ü≥ Give a real-world business problem. Ask the candidate to design and implement a solution from scratch. Discuss trade-offs, architecture, and impact.\n‚Ü≥ Show messy, buggy, insecure code. Ask what‚Äôs wrong, what‚Äôs risky, and how they‚Äôd fix it.\n‚Ü≥ Give raw data. Ask them to build something that adds or creates business value.\n\nThe whole point should be to simulate the real job. Because the real job lives in the real world. And in the real world, there is #AI, whether we want it or not.\n\nSo, let‚Äôs stop testing people on fantasy skills.\n\nIf you have a different idea, let me know üôÇ\n\nP.S. I wrote a blog post many years ago about how I trained for ACM-ICPC contests (LLMs didn‚Äôt exist back then), here's it ‚Üí¬†https://lnkd.in/dqhBvVEh",

        "text": "How can a large company like SEB foster innovation?\n\nThat was the question that my colleague Georg Schuppe addressed yesterday in the session: ‚ÄúSEBx: Innovate Beyond the Future.‚Äù\n\nI  very much agree with his vision: We need to be OK with trying new things and failing. \n\nThe blockers to innovation are common to all big companies:\n‚Ü≥ Employees drowning in repetitive tasks.\n‚Ü≥ Managers too busy to make it a priority.\n‚Ü≥ Data locked behind inaccessible databases.\n‚Ü≥ Brilliant ideas crushed by silence, slow decisions, or KPIs.\n\nThe result?\n‚Ü≥ Stagnation wrapped in legacy systems.\n‚Ü≥ Big dreams with no budget.\n‚Ü≥ ‚ÄúAgile‚Äù in name only.\n\nSo how to break it out?\n\nI think we need to understand that innovation isn‚Äôt a fuzzy buzzword.\n\nIt‚Äôs a system!\n\nAnd systems must scale if designed correctly. \n\nMcKinsey & Company describes innovation based on three horizons:\n\n1. Core (Incremental change):\n‚Ü≥ Defend and extend what already works.\n‚Ü≥ For example, to create internal tools, automate existing processes, or make small improvements.\n\n2. Emerging (Disruptive change):\n‚Ü≥ Build what‚Äôs next.\n‚Ü≥ For example, SEB Embedded came from the idea of banking as a service, which wasn‚Äôt such a cool idea 10 years ago, it was a bet that paid off.\n\n3. Future (Transformational change):\n‚Ü≥ Invent the unthinkable.\n‚Ü≥ For example, 5 years ago, a superintelligent AI assistant in your pocket felt like sci-fi, today it is transforming multiple industries. \n\nSo...\n\nTo unlock Core innovation:\n‚Ü≥ Give people time and basic resources.\n‚Ü≥ Let them fix what‚Äôs broken in their daily work.\n‚Ü≥ And reward those who dare to care.\n\nTo foster Emerging innovation:\n‚Ü≥ Create a multidisciplinary ecosystem of experts.\n‚Ü≥ Give them support from the business to prototype, test, and implement innovative concepts swiftly and effectively.\n‚Ü≥ Let them move fast, fail publicly, and try again.\n\nTo pursue Future innovation:\n‚Ü≥ Fund the long game.\n‚Ü≥ Protect wild ideas from quarterly goals.\n‚Ü≥ Empower your visionaries, not only to deliver, but also to dream.\n\nBecause‚Ä¶\n\nThe future doesn‚Äôt wait for a greenlight from leadership. It arrives, whether you‚Äôre ready or not.\n\nSo here's a question for you:\n\nDoes your company has built an innovation system? \n\nIf yes, üëè",

No fancy edits. Just background removal.\n\nI tried multiple prompts. Tweaked the wording. Iterated many times on the pictures asking to only change the background, and repeated the process.\n\nEvery result failed.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the generated images didn‚Äôt look like me.\n\nThe differences were subtle: slightly off eyes, jawline, weird teeth, or unreal skin tone. Yet, they were enough to break the illusion (down below is the best result I got üëá).\n\nHere‚Äôs the problem: the model has never seen me before.\n\nUnless you‚Äôre a public figure, an actor, a politician, or someone with a massive online presence (i.e., online pictures) these models can only guess.\n\nSo, the current limitations of current AI models aren't the models themselves. It‚Äôs the training data!\n\nSo, the next time you deploy a #GenAI solution in production, remember this:\n\nWithout the right data, even the smartest model could fly blind üôà",

Dusty. Too verbose. Too ‚Äúenterprisey.‚Äù\n\nWrong.\n\nJava quietly powers much of the real world.\nFrom the Spotify app on your phone to backend systems moving trillions of financial transactions, Java is there. Relentless. Invisible. Indispensable.\n\nIt runs Android, Inc. Netflix. LinkedIn. Minecraft. Most banks. Many governments.\nIt‚Äôs everywhere.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause Java works!\nIt‚Äôs stable. Fast.

You just enhance what you already have.\n\nMoreover, I think Java teaches us how to think like an engineer.\nWith strong types and well-established design patterns, Java encourages discipline.

        "text": "Today, I attended the dbt Labs meetup at Solita's office in Stockholm. Here‚Äôs a key insight I took away:\n\nThe \"semantic layer\" is a big deal for both businesses and developers.\n\nJohan Baltzar shared his journey as a Data Engineer in Spotify‚Äôs early days and how a deep understanding of the semantic layer played a crucial role in helping the Swedish ü¶Ñ scale from A to B (as shown in the pictures ‚á£).\n\nWhat is the semantic layer? (just in case you wonder)\n\nIt‚Äôs a logical abstraction that translates raw data structures (tables, columns, schemas) into user-friendly, meaningful business terms.\n\nFor example, imagine two departments independently calculating revenue. Without a semantic layer, they could report wildly different numbers, both technically correct but confusingly inconsistent. A semantic layer ensures everyone speaks the same language from the start, providing a single, trustworthy definition for terms like \"revenue\".\n\nModern data stacks increasingly rely on semantic layers to democratize data analytics. Looker, Tableau, PowerBI.bg, and dbt Labs all offer semantic-layer capabilities, making it a hot topic in the business world!\n\nThanks to the organizers, I'm looking forward to the next dbt Labs event. ü•Ç",

Furthermore, PySpark is good enough for most use cases (even Databricks heavily supports Python for ML workloads).\n\n#Java has caught up, especially with Project Loom and its upcoming features, and any companies that previously used Scala for microservices (e.g., Twitter/X) migrated back to Java or Kotlin.\n\nMoreover, I find Scala cumbersome to learn as a programming language. It's a mix of object-oriented and functional paradigms, and the syntax is not very intuitive (although this might be personal preference).\n\nSo, why does Scala still exist?\n\nFirst, some companies (especially in finance, big data, and ad-tech) have large Scala-based Spark codebases.\n\nSecond, Python APIs (like PySpark) introduce some overhead, as Python needs to communicate with the JVM (via Py4J), which can be a bottleneck in some cases.\n\nFinally, if you enjoy functional programming paradigms (e.g., higher-order functions, pattern matching, and monads), Scala still does them slightly better than Java.\n\nSo, I strongly believe that learning Scala isn't worth it unless your company uses Spark, of course. But if you're mainly doing AI or ML, it's better to focus on Python instead.\n\nFinally, a question for you:\n\nDo you still use Scala, seriously?",

The job market in tech didn‚Äôt make any sense. We used to live in a Nirvana.\n\nWe all know that. For years, software engineers were untouchable: high salaries, lavish perks, job security, etc.\n\nI personally never felt good about this situation, as I couldn‚Äôt understand how it was possible that seasoned school teachers earned less than junior software engineers.\n\nNow we‚Äôre seeing more and more layoffs in the tech sector and definitely not the same level of security as before.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause cheap money fueled the tech boom in the 2010s. Companies could afford anything: mass hirings, paying ridiculous salaries, and even maintaining open-source projects. Profitability didn‚Äôt matter much when money flowed the way it did.\n\nThen interest rates spiked. Less money from investors, and the game changed.\n\nThe hard truth is thay most tech companies never really cared about open source or sustainability. They were just indulgences for devs in an era of excess.\n\nNow, job security depends on one thing: delivering value that is connected to whatever your company cares about the most.\n\nBut there‚Äôs nothing special about this. In fact, this is how businesses operate in the real world. What was actually special was the previous job market situation.\n\nBesides, I think the rise of AI has definitely aggravated this. And for now, it‚Äôs merely the expectation of such an impact that causes companies to hire more cautiously.\n\nRegarding AI, here‚Äôs what I think we should focus on in order to remain appreciated:\n\nüîπ Move efforts to where actual value is created (the specific business value is often the hardest part to automate with AI).\n\nüîπ Embrace AI, and even better, advocate for it (such a huge and rare opportunity to become an innovator).\n\nüîπ Accept the reality that AI isn‚Äôt going anywhere and that the good old times are over (things aren‚Äôt going to be as they used to be).\n\nLet‚Äôs see how it goes because maybe this is just the beginning of another golden age that we still haven‚Äôt understood.\n\nWho knows? ü§∑",

A century ago, handwriting was such a crucial skill, people took pride in their calligraphy. Today, \"writing\" no longer means putting words with a pen on paper, now it‚Äôs about structuring readable ideas in a digital format.\n\nThe same shift is happening in coding. The act of \"writing code\" will be automated. What will remain is the higher-order skill of thinking systematically in a way that could guide an AI to turn ideas into executable programs that deliver some sort of value.\n\nSo, a few questions before ending this rambling: \n\nShould we still teach coding the hard way (i.e., without AI) like we still teach handwriting in schools? Or will that just feel awkward and outdated? Are we gonna lose the ability to write code from scratch?\n\nI don‚Äôt know.

In real life, we don‚Äôt communicate with everyone the same way. We adapt our message based on whom we‚Äôre speaking to and in which environment we are.\n\nYet today‚Äôs websites and apps treat (almost) every customer identically. AI agents are about to end this impersonal online interaction by creating hyper-personalized experiences (i.e., far beyond simple ML recommendation systems).\n\nThe future looks very much agentic, IMHO.\n\nAnd the black boxes will become even darker üóÉÔ∏è",

        "text": "I‚Äôm totally convinced that career growth isn‚Äôt about climbing a title ladder.\n\nWe tend to position ourselves within specific categories (e.g., developer, senior engineer, staff engineer, director, CEO, you name it), expecting to jump from one to another eventually.\n\nBut the real game isn‚Äôt about titles at all, it‚Äôs about conquering complexity.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the amount of value we can create is directly tied to the level of complexity at which we operate.\n\nHere‚Äôs a simple heuristic for assessing where you are in our careers and how to reach the next level:\n\nüîπ First, you‚Äôre told WHAT to do AND HOW to do it (e.g., junior engineer).\nüîπ Then, you‚Äôre just told WHAT to do (e.g., senior engineer).\nüîπ Next, you‚Äôre ASKED HOW to do it (e.g., staff engineer).\nüîπ Eventually, you‚Äôll be ASKED WHAT should be done (e.g., director).\nüîπ Finally, no one tells or asks you ANYTHING, you‚Äôll set the goals yourself (e.g., executive level).\n\nDo you see it?\n\nEach step you climb makes you less vulnerable because the amount of value you can deliver increases exponentially. And this happens because your capacity to handle more complexity increases. Low complexity ‚Üí staying at the bottom ‚Üí higher risk of being replaced.\n\nSo, our real career growth is actually shaped by the challenges we must conquer to climb the complexity ladder.\n\nFor example, here‚Äôs a roadmap for developers:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ First, we must master the art of managing complexity in code. We should learn algorithms, exploratory data analysis (EDA), software architecture, and so.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Second, knowing how to code isn‚Äôt enough. We must identify which problems are worth solving. The complexity here lies in navigating uncertainty and delivering real-world value.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Third, we must make sense of chaos. Leaders at the highest levels don‚Äôt just solve problems, they choose which problems matter. They craft narratives, shape strategies, and define purpose.\n\nSo, let‚Äôs stop obsessing over titles. Instead, let‚Äôs ask ourselves: \"Which layer am I in, and what level of complexity am I ready to conquer next?‚Äù\n\nThat‚Äôs how real growth happens ü™ú\n\nP.S.

This creates an environment where tailored AI agents can interact, take action, and deliver value without human intervention.\n\nI believe this technology has the potential to accelerate processes with incredible efficiency.\n\nFor example, I just watched a demo of the coming Google Agentspace. The deployment of agents there allowed the creation of a live onboarding guide for new hires... in seconds! The key innovation is that it continuously updates with information that is specific to the given employee role.\n\nHere are some of the most interesting features of agentic ecosystems:\n\nüîπ Task sharing: AI agents can pass tasks to each other to complete more complex activities.\n\nüîπ Guardrails: We can impose restrictions on the agents to regulate their actions (to some extent).\n\nüîπ Action logs: We‚Äôll have detailed logs (a.k.a. traces) showing exactly what AI agents are doing at each step.\n\nJust as cloud services revolutionized IT infrastructure a few years ago, agentic ecosystems scale very well and can be applied to practically any use case involving automation. The competition will be fierce in this space. Ouch. \n\nIn the meantime, I can only hope this will help cut down bureaucracy and paperwork across industries.\n\nWe‚Äôll see üçø\n\nP.S.

From feature engineering to model evaluation, these systems deliver the precision and resilience that traditional methods simply cannot.\n\nConcretely, the paper focuses on two use cases for agentic AI systems:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ FINANCIAL MODELING: The agentic crew consists of a manager and multiple agents who perform specific tasks such as exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, model training, model evaluation, and writing documentation.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT: The agentic  crew consists of a manager along with specialized agents who perform tasks such as checking compliance of modeling documentation, model replication, conceptual soundness, analysis of outcomes, and writing documentation.\n\nThe results show that AI agents can effectively collaborate to perform these complex tasks in real-time.\n\nThe agents were able to streamline the modeling workflow, carry out model risk management procedures on a trained model, and effectively manage dependencies as well as collaboration among other agents.\n\nThe novelty of these models is that they learn, adapt, and evolve by themselves. For example, they can detect fraud with unprecedented accuracy, approve credit with confidence, and manage portfolio risk with unmatched efficiency.\n\nEventually, there will be adaptive learning agents that continuously improve their performance through past interactions and the various feedback they receive. Another even more interesting improvement will be agents capable of developing their own agents, tools, and tasks required for specific operations.\n\nAre we about to reach the next frontier in financial modeling?\n\nOr have we already surpassed it?\n\nHere‚Äôs the paper: üîó https://lnkd.in/dCH_jSjg",

Yet, true innovation occurs only when these powerful ideas and tools meet genuine user needs (i.e., when AI becomes customer-centric).\n\nFor example, the invention of #LLMs was impressive, but it became innovative only when products like ChatGPT made them accessible, intuitive, and impactful for millions of everyday users.\n\nOn the other hand, sometimes inventions are ahead of their time precisely because they're too customer-centric. They assume customer needs that don't yet exist or aren't yet understood (e.g., Microsoft‚Äôs Clippy).\n\nToday, I believe many AI startups fail because they're too \"ahead of their users,\" disconnected from real-world needs. They're brilliant, but not relatable.\n\nIt‚Äôs the deliberate act of understanding and anticipating customer desires (and frustrations) the thing that transforms impressive AI inventions into powerful innovations.\n\nCorollary ‚Üí Invention alone isn't enough.\n\nIt is the act of understanding users that actually turns inventions into impactful innovations. \n\nSo let‚Äôs keep creating new things with curiosity, but innovate with empathy and common sense. \n\nWishing you a great weekend!¬†üòâ",

Newcomers like Langfuse, Gorilla, and Chainlit are rapidly reshaping the market. Even Dify, a newer player, has surged dramatically.\n\nBut here's the shocking part:\n\nWhen looking at where contributions come from (measured by the number of pull-requests), the #US and #China completely dominate the landscape. Europe is almost invisible.\n\nWhy aren‚Äôt we seeing more European open-source projects shaping the future of LLMs? Is it a lack of awareness? Funding? Community support?\n\nOne thing is clear: if Europe doesn't actively engage now, it risks being left behind‚Ä¶ sidelined in one of the most crucial technological revolutions of our lifetime!\n\nLet‚Äôs change that.

If you want to track the hottest open-source projects or uncover hidden gems, this is the place to look.\n\nMy favorite feature is the Collections tab. It categorizes repositories by domain (AI, LLMs, crypto, finance, and more) while also tracking their historical ranking by relevant metrics with cool visualizations.\n\nFor example, the video below shows the popularity of repositories in the AI category from February 2011 to March 2025, based on the number of GitHub stars. We can see that scikit-learn was a big player for almost 5 years (these were the golden days of traditional ML), then the arrival of Deep Learning took the lead with TensorFlow and reigned for many years, until recently PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers started closing the gap.\n\nOSS Insight also has a data explorer feature that allows you to query the data in natural language.

I expected the interview to start at 15:00, and at 15:15, I asked the receptionist if I could somehow contact him.\n\nSo she called the interviewer. While waiting, I checked my phone, and my heart sank.\n\nThe interview was supposed to start at 14:00. For some reason, I thought it was at 15:00. Bang!\n\nI was 1 hour late.\n\nAt that moment, I felt like a complete failure, but I was already there, and running away from trouble is not my thing.\n\nThe interviewer arrived at 15:30.\n\nWe shook hands, and he led me into a meeting room.\n\nI didn‚Äôt make excuses.

        "text": "Why is it impossible to compress all human knowledge into an AI model?\n\nI could hardly imagine a world where every published book, every scientific discovery ever made, and every human thought is compressed into a single AI that knows EVERYTHING.\n\nNevertheless, it sounds like the ultimate achievement, right? \n\nBut this type of data compression has fundamental limits, dictated by Kolmogorov complexity, Shannon‚Äôs information theory, and the nature of knowledge.\n\nLet's have a deeper look at these three limitations:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ The shortest possible description of any dataset is its Kolmogorov complexity. It represents the length of the smallest algorithm that can generate it. It is uncomputable in the general case, meaning no algorithm can determine the absolute shortest representation of arbitrary data.\n\nFurthermore, some sequences have no algorithmically shorter description than themselves, they are incompressible. While much of human knowledge follows structured patterns, large portions contain chaotic unpredictability, making a truly lossless compression of everything fundamentally impossible.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Shannon‚Äôs information theory defines entropy as the minimum number of bits needed to optimally encode a message. High-entropy data has less redundancy and cannot be compressed beyond a fundamental limit.\n\nThe problem is that not all human knowledge is low-entropy. While structured facts can be compressed efficiently, much of what we call \"knowledge\" includes uncertainty, noise, ambiguity, and subjective interpretation. Some knowledge is inherently probabilistic, meaning it lacks a fully deterministic structure that allows for compression.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Even if we could encode all knowledge at one moment, it would immediately become outdated. Knowledge is non-stationary, i.e., it is not a fixed dataset but an evolving process.\n\nNew discoveries invalidate old assumptions, cultural contexts shift, and scientific revolutions rewrite fundamental truths. A model that captures \"everything\" today will still fail to encapsulate what comes next.\n\nSo what?\n\nAI models, no matter how advanced, function as approximate compression algorithms: identifying patterns, reducing complexity, and reconstructing knowledge efficiently. \n\nBut as just discussed, compression is never perfect.\n\nSomething is always lost. And what‚Äôs lost might be the very essence of intelligence itself: intuition, serendipity, and the unforeseen connections that drive human creativity.\n\nSo, would it ever be possible to build a super-intelligent AI that encapsulates everything?\n\nNo.\n\nAnd even though the latest AI models seem to be very competent (think of ChatGPT 4.5 and o1),... folks, let‚Äôs not forget the fundamental limits of what is truly possible üß†",

Once delivered, the file could be loaded to perform inference on real-time and real-world data.\n\nWhat‚Äôs inside?\n\nThat file encodes what the model have  learned. The weights and biases that determine how it makes predictions. Combined with its architecture (in the case of neural networks) or parameters (for statistical models), this forms the brain of an AI system.\n\nBut this brain is actually patterns extracted from massive datasets, fine-tuned neural network weights, decision tree splits, and distilled knowledge from everything the model has learned.

Just one number to keep in mind.\n\nFor example, if your investment grows at 8% per year, it will take:\n\n72 / 8 = 9 years to reach 2x its value\n\nHere's why I use the Rule of 72:\n\n‚Üí Quick mental math to estimate returns for interest rates between 6% and 10%.\n‚Üí Works for inflation, population growth, and investment returns.\n‚Üí Simple but powerful trick for quick financial decisions.\n\nüåü Pro tip: For rates under 6%, use 69 instead of 72 for more accuracy. For rates over 10%, use 75 to get closer to the truth.",

        "text": "How are the hyperparameters of LLMs fine-tuned without blowing up already massive budgets? üí∞\n\nAs we know, when training \"small\" ML models, we can afford to test different hyperparameters repeatedly, tweaking them until we get the best results. But with LLMs? There‚Äôs usually only one shot at training.\n\nSo, I just went deep into different hyperparameter tuning techniques for LLMs and discovered the concept of \"scaling extrapolation.\"\n\nIn essence, it‚Äôs the process of predicting which hyperparameters will work best on large models based on testing smaller ones. Scaling extrapolation is crucial because training large models is a massive resource drain, and we just can‚Äôt afford to mess around with endless combinations.\n\nWhy does it works?\n\nEmpirical research has shown that many optimal hyperparameters remain stable when model size changes. For example, a 2022 paper from researchers at Microsoft and OpenAI demonstrated that it is possible to transfer hyperparameters from a 40M model to a 6.7B model: üîó https://lnkd.in/dY3Ef6Vk\n\nInterestingly, scaling extrapolation is still a niche field, tackled by only a few experts.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it‚Äôs incredibly complex. If we have just 10 hyperparameters, we‚Äôre already looking at over 1,000 combinations to test. The complexity explodes as more hyperparameters interact with each other.\n\nI find this challenge fascinating.\n\nFor now, it‚Äôs very unlikely that will be working on training large models at this scale. However, what seemed large two years ago is considered small today. Staying ahead means knowing about techniques (like scaling extrapolation) before they become essential. This is how we break through.\n\nWant to dive deeper into scaling extrapolation? Check out this insightful blog post: üîó https://lnkd.in/dhMctqYc by luke metz.\n\nThere‚Äôs no doubt: hyperparameter tuning has already reached the next level üöÄ",

It includes everything from $50 bug fixes to $32,000 full-stack feature builds, covering web, mobile, APIs, and cross-codebase interactions.\n\nThe initial benchmark results? \n\nWell... the paper claims that AI still falls short, but I believe the results are already quite impressive.\n\nThe best model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, managed to earn $208,050 out of a possible $500,800 in the SWE-Lancer Diamond subset. On the full dataset, it scraped together $400,000 out of $1 million. Of course, still not quite there yet to fully replacing human engineers, but already BIG if we consider it‚Äôs just the beginning.\n\nWhat‚Äôs next?\n\nAI-assisted software development will reshape the job market (without any doubt) especially for freelancers and junior engineers (as stated in the ‚ÄúImpact Statement‚Äù section 7 in the paper). However, we're still far from having fully autonomous AI engineers. More importantly, AI-generated code also comes with serious risks.

This approach has its merits, e.g., we can fine-tune the model to meet our specific needs and ensure that the data is good enough before launching. However, with pre-trained models already available, this process is painfully slow and inefficient. Why? Because we could spend weeks or months gathering the right data and fine-tuning our model(s)... while the product remains in a constant flux.\n\nThankfully, we don‚Äôt need to follow that path anymore.\n\nWhen building on top of foundational models, instead of getting stuck in endless data wrangling, we can start by building the product with AI-generated data and see if it works for a pilot number of users. Once we‚Äôve got something promising, we can do real data and model optimizations. \n\nI find this shift a game-changer!\n\nIt isn‚Äôt about creating better user interfaces powered by AI, it‚Äôs about getting the product to market faster. And that means we can start understanding real user needs much earlier, adapt quickly, and iterate faster.\n\nFor example, imagine you‚Äôre developing a new app aimed at helping small businesses manage their finances. Before, you would have spent months analyzing customer data, cleaning it, and fine-tuning a model. But then, after a while, you find out the users didn‚Äôt actually want to reduce expenses, what they wanted was to better understand customers to maximize ROI instead. By leading with the product first, we could have launched an early version, gathered ROI feedback, and launched accordingly without waiting for Model v1.0 to be ready.\n\nSo, getting to market faster is a huge advantage. The quicker we get the feedback, the quicker we can adjust, and the better we can refine our offering to match what users ACTUALLY want, not just what we think they want üòâ\n\nWe don‚Äôt need perfect data, we need quicker insights. We can build, test, and adjust along the way.\n\nJust start building, and let it go üöÄ",

Why?\n\nBecause nearly every small coding problem I can think of has already been solved, and the unsolved ones are too big for me to solve alone. Furthermore, AI-powered coding assistants can generate high-quality code faster than I ever could. With a simple prompt, they can build entire applications, optimize algorithms, and refactor complex codebases.\n\nSo, do we still need to know the nitty-gritty details of syntax and classical algorithms?\n\nProbably not.\n\n‚Üí Manually implementing a sorting algorithm? ‚ùå \n\n‚Üí Understanding the nuances of pointer arithmetic in C? ‚ùå \n\n‚Üí Memorizing syntax rules for multiple programming languages? ‚ùå \n\nSo, what do we need instead?\n\n‚Üí The ability to ask the right QUESTIONS and EVALUATE AI-generated responses ‚úÖ\n\nThese are the new technical skills that will define the future of learning (in almost every other field, I believe).\n\nOur education system needs to shift accordingly.

Imagine a user asks a question, and the system digs into a personalized data pool for context, and then through GenAI it delivers a coherent, relevant response.\n\nWe can use multimodal RAG in video games, and I‚Äôm particularly excited about MRAG‚Äôs potential to create games that are both more engaging and intellectually stimulating.\n\nTraditionally, Non-Player Characters (NPCs) rely on static, hardcoded responses. But with MRAG, we can make them dynamic, lifelike, and far more engaging to interact with. For example, we can build NPCs that not only respond intelligently but also interact with each other, pursue goals, and move dynamically within the game world (all powered by complex RAG workflows).\n\nThis is exactly what Alexander explored in his session, and it‚Äôs a game-changer. He showed how much more fun it could be for gamers to interact with NPCs that are smart enough to search for and display multimedia assets. \n\nTwo examples: 1Ô∏è‚É£ an NPC finding and playing a metal song that matches the player‚Äôs mood in a specific game scenario, or 2Ô∏è‚É£ interpreting the player‚Äôs own paintings in real-time.\n\nCool, huh?",

Some of the papers I‚Äôm most proud of have taken years to gain traction (e.g., my DepClean paper currently ranked 1st in my profile took 3 years to get traction), while other papers have got cited quickly due to trending topics or collaborative networks (e.g., my Data Mining in sports paper, ranked 2nd in my profile took me by surprise).\n\nWhat have I learned about citations?\n\n‚Üí High-quality work, even if initially overlooked, will eventually get cited. The prestige of the journal or conference definitely plays a role, but solid research speaks for itself over time.\n\n‚Üí Co-authoring with researchers from different institutions or disciplines increases exposure, leading to more citations.\n\n‚Üí Even highly specialized research can gain significant attention if it addresses a critical gap or introduces a novel perspective.\n\nFor most researchers, the number of citations per year tends to grow linearly but eventually plateaus. I predict mine might actually decrease this year, as I‚Äôve mostly stepped away from academia üòÅ \n\nThat said, I‚Äôm still open to academic research collaborations!\n\nIf you‚Äôre working on something exciting and think we could collaborate, feel free to reach out üôÇ",

        "text": "Documenting source code is a waste of time and space nowadays üóëÔ∏è\n\nI still remember the days when we were arguing about different documentation practices and paradigms. Then, tools like Doxygen, Javadoc, and Sphinx were created to FORCE us (lazy developers) to explain our code in an organized way using \"templates.\" They extracted API signatures, methods, parameters, and more, transforming them into human-readable form, often in HTML or Markdown formats, so that our colleagues and future versions of ourselves could easily understand what the code was supposed to do.\n\nBut our battle tested doc tools are not very useful anymore.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause current AI can generate good enough documentation automatically for us. For example, GitHub Copilot's chat can answer the ‚Äúwhat it does‚Äù and the ‚Äúhow it does it‚Äù questions for any function (in milliseconds and with very high accuracy) ü§Ø\n\nSo, code documentation has fallen into automation, becoming a commodity.\n\nIndeed, I believe that most code documentation today is actually noise.\n\nThink about it. Today, IDEs help us create meaningful variable names easily. They generate all kinds of templates. Typing is not what slows us down anymore: READING IS! The more code we have to read, the longer it takes to understand what needs to be changed in the codebase. So documentation becomes a waste of time in the eyes of efficient developers.\n\nSo, should all comments disappear?\n\nThe only scenario in which writing a comment makes sense to me is when we use it to add information about the ‚Äúwhy this way.‚Äù For example, adding a comment when checking for the existence of a specific configuration file in a function to ensure that custom settings load correctly for various deployment environments. This kind of info adds more ‚Äúcontext‚Äù about why the code does what a prompted AI said it does (i.e., it reflects the human decision made along the way).\n\nIn essence, future documentation requires a narrative. Without it, you just wind up splatting unnecessary words on a codebase, rather than communicating anything useful to the other devs or their AI partners.\n\nAnd yes, I‚Äôm sorry for the billions of lines of open-source comments and the many human hours invested in them (nothing wrong because they have helped build the AI models after all).\n\nR.I.P. my dear Javadoc ü™¶",

They have used MY work to train THEIR models. Now, they‚Äôre claiming this as their data and #profiting from it.\n\nFor example, below is the response from ChatGPT when asked about \"The Last Paper‚Äôs Myth,\" something I wrote about last year.

We‚Äôre already seeing this trend!\n\n‚Ä¢ Writers might become discouraged from producing long-form content because it‚Äôs not gratifying to spend hours writing just for the sake of feeding an AI that will plagiarize* and sell their ideas (people like writing for other people, not machines).\n\n‚Ä¢ We could fall into a dangerous cycle of (mis)information convergence, where we simply trust whatever an AI \"understands\" about a topic. This is very risky for ideological freedom and literacy.\n\nOver the years, we‚Äôve built a system where free, open science coexists together with closed journals and patents. It‚Äôs far from perfect, but at least authorship and attribution are #respected.\n\nThe current AI race, however, doesn‚Äôt operate like that at all!\n\nSo here I am, once again, tying to rise awareness, and hoping to see truly free, open-code, open-data, and open-weights models to be the ones going first at the end of this AI race.\n\nTime will tell‚Ä¶ ‚åõ\n\n*plagiarize ‚Üí :¬†to steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own¬†:¬†use (another's production) without crediting the source (The Merriam-Webster Dictionary).",

        "text": "*Multitasking* doesn‚Äôt work, we all know that. But really?\n\nWe live in a world where juggling many tasks is hard to avoid. We deal with a bombardment of real-time messaging threads, emails popping up, and online meetings, often all at once. What is worst, this kind of #multitasking is sometimes perceived as a sign of efficiency ü§Ø\n\nIn this era of perpetual distraction, understanding the limits of our multitasking capabilities is crucial for optimizing work #performance. \n\nSo, I looked into this topic and stumbled upon an interesting paper from 2011 that showed empirical evidence that multitasking can improve productivity, but only up to a certain point: üîóhttps://lnkd.in/gAvHFfXN\n\nThe paper‚Äôs findings are pretty clear: medium multitaskers perform reasonably well when it comes to handling many computer-based multitasking tasks, while high multitaskers suffer from it. However, accuracy declines steadily with increased multitasking, no matter how much you juggle! üôÑ\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶juggling multiple tasks is much more difficult while balancing on a high wire, where performance mishaps can have serious consequences.‚Äù\n\nThe results follow a classic inverted-U curve for productivity: multitasking helps until it doesn't. At first, switching between tasks boosts your mental alertness and efficiency. But after a certain point, switching too often leads to mental #overload, making it harder to maintain focus and accuracy on mid complexity tasks.\n\nSo, what does this mean for us in 2025? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nOver the last decade, we‚Äôve exponentially increased the number of information channels we juggle at work. It‚Äôs likely that many of us have BECOME high multitaskers in the process, without even noticing it.\n\nTo maintain both speed and accuracy, we should focus on fewer tasks at a time (ideally in sequence, without overlap). And if you ever feel overloaded, take a step back, evaluate your multitasking habits, and aim for that sweet spot where productivity is achieved without compromising #quality.\n\nSeriously, too much multitasking can seriously compromise the quality of our work.\n\nIt‚Äôs all about balance and awareness üòâ\n\n*A common form of multitasking occurs when a user shifts attention to perform several independent but concurrent computer-based tasks.",

Then, everything shifted toward Deep Learning thanks to the availability of powerful hardware. More recently, it all seems to be about leveraging the greatest minds with the best ideas to put them all #together.\n\nBut I argue that one thing has remained unchanged: the need to process massive amounts of messy #data, and that this is the everlasting skill ü™Ñ\n\nJust as an example, the creators of DeepSeek shared their model architecture and its trained weights with the world as open-source. But what‚Äôs the one thing they kept completely secret? Their training data ü§î\n\nSo, if I could only master ONE skill, it wouldn‚Äôt be tweaking models or fine-tuning hyperparameters. It would be handling data at #scale, i.e., building efficient pipelines, automating workflows, and ensuring data quality.

However, I haven‚Äôt felt the impact personally. Why? Because these advancements now focus on narrowing AI‚Äôs expertise into specific knowledge areas.\n\nIndeed, researchers are now working to automate AI research itself, which could theoretically trigger a rapid increase of scientific #discoveries across specific domains (inc. foundational science).\n\nLet‚Äôs take #software development as an example. To better evaluate AI‚Äôs coding abilities, researchers developed SWE-Bench (a benchmark that tests how well AI can solve actual open issues in popular OSS). Just one year ago, the top verified score was 4.4%, but today, OpenAI‚Äôs o3 model achieves an astonishing 72%. This leap is a milestone toward automating the software craft.\n\nBut at the same time, the gap between AI‚Äôs public face and its true capabilities is widening. \n\nProgress is now measured at the level of AI models with PhD-level expertise in niche areas of knowledge.\n\nThis makes it harder for the public and policymakers to grasp AI‚Äôs real progress, much less regulate it effectively.\n\nThe risk isn‚Äôt that AI development has stalled.

In factories, there were production lines, and manual workers were hands-on, performing repetitive tasks (does that ring a bell, developers?). Later, thanks to automation and digitalization, people had to increase their knowledge of the systems and manage them as engineers.\n\nIn a few years, AI agents will take over most engineering jobs. Nevertheless, we will still need to stay close to the #business to #understand it and provide proper instructions to the robots (unless they find a way to make money on their own, which I believe is very unlikely).\n\nThis disruption will extend not only to #engineers but also to #managers and all kinds of administrative human employees.\n\nAs a countermeasure, many new #regulations will likely emerge, creating jobs focused on managing these AI systems more securely.\n\nAfter all, we invented Agile, Jira, and other tools that created new roles focused on managing developers. We couldn‚Äôt fully understand how software development worked or how to make software #products.

In factories, there were production lines, so manual workers were hands-on doing repetitive tasks (does that ring a bell developers?). Later, thanks to #automation and digitalization, people had to increase their knowledge of the systems and manage them as engineers.\n\nIn a few years, AI #agents could take over most engineering jobs. Nevertheless, we will still need to stay close to the business to understand it and give proper instructions to the robots (unless they find a way to make money on their own, which I believe is very unlikely).\n\nThis #disruption will spread not only to engineers but also to managers and all kinds of administrative human employees.\n\nAs a countermeasure, many new regulations will emerge, creating jobs focused on managing these AI systems in a more secure way.\n\nAfter all, we invented Agile, Jira, and other tools that created new #jobs focused on managing developers (cause businesses couldn‚Äôt fully understand how software development works or how to make software products).

For example, when I was a teenager, I didn‚Äôt fully grasp the true importance of active learning and honestly didn‚Äôt know what I wanted to do (I bet many of you felt the same). I studied anyway, maybe because I had plenty of free time, but I wasn‚Äôt entirely convinced it would lead ANYWHERE.\n\nLater, I started following my path, but I was WAITING for opportunities to show up. I had a plan and was working toward it, but deep down, I was more reliant on hope than action.\n\nToday, I see opportunities EVERYWHERE. In fact, there are far too many of them in this digital world. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm baffled when I hear people my age complain about a lack of opportunities.\n\nFor me, the real challenge isn‚Äôt finding opportunities, it‚Äôs managing the paradox of choice: How do I #invest my limited #time in the most rewarding one? Because everything has an opportunity cost.\n\nHave you ever thought about this?\n\nPS: This paradox of choice is a concept popularized by psychologist Barry Schwartz in his book ‚ÄúThe Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less.‚Äù The core idea is that while having some choice is essential for autonomy and well-being, too much choice can lead to decreased happiness and increased regret.",

        "text": "What is DORA and why should we care about it?\n\nThe Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) is a game-changer for the financial industry in the EU. It came into effect last Friday, January 17th, 2025 (yes, politicians deploy on Fridays ü§Ø). DORA pushes financial entities across the EU to meet stricter #standards to stay #resilient against #cyberattacks and ICT #disruptions. üíª‚ö°\n\nIf you work in the FinTech sector, DORA is a big deal because:\n\nüîí It enforces robust risk management frameworks to protect systems from breaches and outages.\nüì¢ It mandates that firms must report major ICT incidents quickly to tackle threats head-on.\nüéØ Expect rigorous operational stress tests, including threat-led penetration testing.\nü§ù It‚Äôs not just banks and financial firms; cloud providers and other ICT vendors must meet compliance too.\n\nFor financial institutions üè¶, adapting to DORA is a massive #commitment, perhaps comparable in scale to MiFID and GDPR. A crucial part of this is identifying critical software functions and their dependencies on third-party vendors(ranging from tech giants to smaller SaaS providers). Aligning all these parties with DORA is challenging but necessary to ensure the availability of critical services, even in the face of large-scale cyberattacks.\n\nFor developers üßë‚Äçüíª, this means more job #opportunities in the financial industry and a growing demand for enhanced resilience into every software solution we build (i.e., setting stronger security protocols, seamless collaboration with risk teams, and designing systems that can handle critical disruptions in real time).\n\nDORA is not just about compliance, it's a commitment, and a call to action to create a more secure financial ecosystem with operational resilience! üöÄ",

She emphasized the importance of fully believing in who you want to become and wholeheartedly embracing that identity. She said (to herself) at some point in her career: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be THE magician girl in a suit and heels, and I‚Äôm also going to educate others on how to win the business game as an entertainer.‚Äù\n\nShe also highlighted the value of personal branding in the business world, explaining that ‚Äúpeople start to associate you with positive vibes.‚Äù One practical tip she shared was to practice power posing for at least two minutes daily (a small habit with a big psychological #impact).\n\nI had an amazing time today with such a wonderful crowd of Swedish entrepreneurs. I learned so much from people who are pushing the boundaries of #creativity and #innovation. As someone put it: ‚ÄúEntrepreneurship is sometimes like building a plane while flying it.‚Äù Challenging? Absolutely. But extremely rewarding as well ü¶Ñ\n\nP.S.

What would you have done differently?\n\nThese were two questions I received from first-year #WASP PhD students yesterday at the WASP Winter Conference in Norrk√∂ping. I feel incredibly fortunate for the opportunity to be on stage sharing my #experiences and #insights with such talented students!\n\nThese were my answers: \n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ My biggest challenge:\n‚ÄúThe hardest part was finding the right balance between working really hard on my PhD (doing a PhD is inherently tough) without compromising my health and avoiding burnout. For me, the real challenge wasn‚Äôt working hard, it was actually knowing when was the right time to stop working and take a pause.‚Äù\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ What I‚Äôd do differently: \n‚ÄúI regret not planning earlier (at least a year in advance) for what comes after completing the PhD. It‚Äôs common among PhD students to get so deeply immersed in the thing that they forget about everything else, because the PhD becomes part of their identity. But graduating isn‚Äôt the end of the journey, it‚Äôs just the beginning. I recommend start preparing for the next phase before the whirlwind of thesis writing, and the chaos of those final months hits!‚Äù\n\nThese are just my personal insights, and every PhD journey is unique‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs what makes it such a special experience!\n\nI‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity to share my stories and engage with #excellent students who will surely become successful researchers and innovators. Many thanks to the WASP ‚Äì Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program for making this opportunity possible and the dream a reality for so many, and thanks to #Sweden for making research a strategic priority for the benefit of the whole society üòä",

While carrots don't \"remove\" radiation, their antioxidants might assist in mitigating some cellular damage caused by radiation exposure.\n\nüí¶ Despite being firm and crunchy, carrots are made up mostly of water.

Identify where they can reduce workload or augment team's outputs (e.g., automating mundane tasks, enhancing decision-making, or streamlining communication workflows).\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Develop AI Literacy: Ensuring everyone in the team understands the fundamentals of how AI works and its current limitations.\n\nWe are standing at the edge of a radical shift in how cognitive work is managed.

An engineer must account for business needs, user behavior, and technical feasibility, which requires human judgment and responsibility.\n\nSo, will AI replace software developers?\n\nI don't think so (at least not anytime soon). But it is fundamentally changing the development landscape, making human creativity and problem-solving capabilities more essential than ever.\n\nAdaptability is one of the most valuable human skills. As long as the world keeps changing, there will always be a need for people who can pivot quickly and come up with creative solutions to the most challenging problems.\n\nIt‚Äôs winter now ‚ùÑÔ∏è.

        "text": "Just before starting every new year, I do two exercises that help me  focus on what‚Äôs important and to achieve my personal goals:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄúWheel of Life‚Äù\n\nI draw 3 lines intersecting at the center of an imaginary circle to divide it into 8 sections. Each line represents one of the following areas of life: money, family and friends, fun, career, personal growth, health, love, and giving.\n\nI rate my satisfaction in each area on a visual scale by marking dots along the radius of each section. Then, I connect the dots to form a shape within the circle.\n\nThe resulting shape gives a visual representation of how \"balanced\" I feel in life. The parts of the shape that are uneven highlight areas where I should focus more attention to improve in the coming year.\n\nI compare the current shape with the previous year‚Äôs shape and reflect on what has improved and what has declined during that time.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄúNew Year Goals‚Äù\n\nI start by revisiting the past year‚Äôs goals and thinking about new goals to improve the current status of my ‚ÄúWheel of Life‚Äù (from exercise 1).\n\nI divide a piece of paper into four quadrants, each representing a quarter of the coming year.\n\nThen, I write no more than 4 goals in each quadrant, following the SMART framework (i.e., Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).\n\nFor example, instead of writing ‚ÄúGetting X certification from Google,‚Äù I write ‚ÄúStudying 4 hours every week to get X certification from Google.‚Äù\n\nI have found that setting smaller goals that are achievable every 3 months works better for me than having bigger yearly goals. The reason is that one year is too much time, and I tend to forget the goals. I also need that dopamine hit that comes just after achieving each goal.\n\nüÜï¬†in 2025, I want to try out the following 3 new productivity hacks:\n\n- Daily focus log (i.e., write down the amount of time I actually focused during the day).\n\n- Weekly review (i.e., spend 15 minutes every Sunday afternoon to look at the status of my quarter and review how it is going).\n\n- Slowing down (i.e., relax more and lower down my expectations of what I can actually achieve during a short period of time). \n\nFootnote: Numerous studies have shown that writing these things on a piece of paper significantly increases the chances of achieving them.\n\nPS: I you have kids, then you know what the drawings on the back are üòÑ",

        "text": "Yesterday, I attended an insightful PyData Meetup in Stockholm, hosted by Solita. Very good discussions there, with highly skilled Data Scientists and hands-on community members.\n\nBelow my thoughts on the 2 talks of the day:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ \"How LLMs work?\" by Jonas Thunberg\n\n‚Üí Understanding embeddings is essential: LLMs use multi-head self-attention to determine which vector embedding aligns best in the vector space. This involves leveraging previous words' semantic (more embeddings!) to develop an abstract understanding of the text‚Äôs meaning.\n\n‚Üí Matrices are everywhere: The fundamental math behind all this stuff is basic operations over matrices and in particular matrix multiplication (that's why GPUs are so expensive nowadays).\n\nü§î I have a question for companies:\n\n‚Üí Do you seek for experts who truly understand the intricate math behind these technologies, or do you prefer speed and practical skills for rapid deployment instead?\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£\"Building RAG for Financial Data\" by Dmitrii Shiriaev\n\n‚Üí RAG is probably the most applicable AI approach for companies at the moment. It requires \"knowing\" and applying many tricks to accurately extract insights from data to enhance search capabilities (e.g., parsing double-column PDFs, or decoding figures to answer specific business questions). So, it looks to me that \"Data Scientist\" are now turned into \"Search Scientists\".\n\n‚Üí The RAG community lacks open resources to learn the best tricks out there. We still have Kaggle for traditional ML knowledge sharing (e.g., for fine tuning models), but current RAG knowledge is mostly empirical, driven by hands-on experimentation with messy corporate internal data.\n\nü§î One thought on this:\n\n‚Üí Many companies are cautious about deploying RAG solutions directly to customers due to potential risks of losing credibility and prestige if some responses are wrong. Building trust in these technologies is still WIP. But we'll get there soon.\n\nHave a great weekend folks!\n\nPS: Many thanks to Sebastian Wallk√∂tter, Ph.D. for arranging and coordinating the event.",

It has graduated over 100 PhD students, and there are 460 on their way. Every week, a new WASP PhD student receives a diploma. Isn't that AMAZING? \n\nBut for any WASP alumni (like me) completing a PhD is just the beginning of another exciting journey.\n\nAt this year's \"WASP Academia and Industry Days,\" the conversation centered on maximizing the unique human resources and opportunities WASP has cultivated in the field of #AI.\n\nThe Big Question: How can Sweden best leverage this exceptional pool of talent?\n\nOne (of the) Answer/s: WASP believes it is possible to drive more innovation and progress in #Sweden by lowering the barriers of collaboration between academia and industry.\n\nNow @ SEB, I can continue contributing to WASP's vision.\n\nSo glad to be part of this!",

There were top-notch presentations, demos, and a well-moderated Q&A session at the end (not to mention the fantastic boat trip across Stockholm's archipelago).\n\nHere are 3 nuggets from the meta-discussion that I still remember:\n\n1. Q: Is choosing a dedicated database always the best option?¬†A: It's important to select a database that best fits the requirements of each specific use case. However, there‚Äôs always a trade-off regarding how much versatility is sacrificed in exchange for performance and vice versa.\n\n2. Q: To what extent does it make sense for an organization to pursue a multi-cloud strategy? A: It enhances resilience, avoids vendor lock-in, and optimizes costs across various services. However, spreading resources across multiple clouds also increases complexity, requiring additional expertise and human talent to manage it effectively.\n\n3. Q: What are proven ways to leverage AI as a key driver for tech transformation in the financial sector?¬†A: AI has shown to be a workhorse in the sector, inc. predictive analytics, automating routine processes, and enhancing customer experiences through personalized services. However, it‚Äôs not a silver bullet, particularly when it comes to building trust and ensuring the reliability of customer-facing services.\n\nMany thanks to Joakim Karlsson for the invitation üôÇ",

Now I know that building an awesome r√©sum√© takes time, effort, and conscious planning.\n\nIt reminds me of the \"attributes\" of a character in an RPG video game. In these games, the character's skills increase over time by \"leveling up\" and progressing to the next level. Similarly, in real life, enhancing a r√©sum√© is a step-by-step process that can only be achieved by gaining experience.\n\nI wrote a blog post about what (I believe) makes a computer scientist's r√©sum√© stand out.\n\nIt all comes down to three things:\n\n1.

What can we learn from the past technical mistakes and successes? \n\nMy latest blog post addresses these questions, with a focus on the engineering paradigms that marked inflection points in web history. \n\nHere is a summary of my observations:\n\nüìÑ Simplicity and Efficiency Holds: Foundational web technologies like static HTML and server-side rendering remain useful for delivering content that rarely changes or doesn't require dynamic processing. These technologies were great in the 90s and continue to be effective and cost-efficient solutions even in 2024 for many use cases.\n\nüé® User Experience Matters: From the introduction of CSS for enhanced web aesthetics to the development of SPAs for dynamic user interactions, the focus on improving user experience has led to the creation of more dynamic technologies for real-time DOM manipulation and improved data fetching, leading to better user experience.\n\n‚ö° Interactivity and Real-Time Communication Are Essential: Technologies such as client-side rendering, AJAX, and WebSockets have redefined user engagement, providing experiences as smooth and responsive as those of desktop applications.\n\nüõ°Ô∏è Security and Performance Are Continuous Priorities: Technologies like WebAssembly offer robust security models and enhanced performance, enabling developers to create high-performant applications with improved security features.\n\nüöÄ Innovation and Adaptability is Not Optional: Developers need to remain flexible and embrace new technologies like WebAssembly and dApps to create cutting-edge web applications that meet the expectations of modern users.\n\n\"Those who don't know tech history are doomed to repeat past engineering mistakes.\"\n\nRead more down below üëá\n\n#WorldWideWeb #WebHistory #WebTechnologies",

It's really cool to see how this wonderful tech allows us to build and run a simple transaction assessment app from scratch... in just 12 minutes! üöÄ\n\nüåü Here are my three favorite features of Copilot:\n1. Seamless IDE integration\n2. Context-aware suggestions\n3. Versatility across engineering roles\n\nHowever, it has some limitations as well:\n1. Occasionally relies on outdated information\n2. Raises some security and privacy concerns\n3. Sometimes generates less efficient code\n\nü§ñ Copilot is a fantastic tool that boosts developer productivity. However, it's important not to forget that we are (at least for now) still **The Pilots**! üòÑ\n\nWhat are your thoughts on using AI tools for coding?\n\n[*] \"Nothing beats watching another developer sweat over something!\" ‚Äî a comment from a colleague after watching my live coding session.\n\n‚Äî\n\nüëá The picture below captured the moment when I was expecting to get a grep regex from Copilot CLI but got a shell command instead due to a typo in my prompt üòÇ.

A truly humbling experience for me to give a cyber security lecture among such prominent security experts that participated in the event. \n\nCongratulations to Renato Athaydes, Chief Engineer at Curity, and his colleague Nikos Anestos for winning the Capture The Flag game. \n\nGreat to see so many developers get so deeply engaged with increasing their cyber security skills at this event. \n\nAwesome speeches also by Pedro Silva from Wiz and Noemi Greco from Google. \n\nAnd of course a huge thanks to all the volunteers that helped us make this event a great experience for all participants. Joel Rudkrantz, Alaufia McCraigon Westerberg, Tijan fatty, Helen Andersson, Alvar Uyttendaele Hillergren, Stine Dhea Arques and Fredrik Paleman.\n\nAnd last but not least Tom-Erik S√∏rensen that arranged the location, food and beverages. Always great to have the support of Peter Molander at Google as well. \n\nComment YES below if you're interested in attending one of our upcoming events: \n* March 27 Meetup at Magello Group\n* April 13 Hackathon at Resolution Games\n* April 20 Hackathon at Magello Group\n* May 11 Hackathon at Nordicstation\n\n#capturetheflag #hackathon #cybersecurity",

SBOMs are essential for software supply chain security.\n2. SBOMs are increasingly getting attention and adoption.\n3. SBOMs are well supported in the Java ecosystem.\n\nMany thanks to the organizers of Jfokus for the opportunity to share my insights on SBOMs at such an excellent conference. My gratitude also extends to my esteemed colleagues from SEB for their unwavering support. A special shoutout to G√∂ran Ramsfeldt, Martin Blixt, and Matilda Nordquist for their encouragement.

A truly magnificent event from start to finish ‚ú®\n\nI think one very special thing that conferences offer us is the opportunity to meet the tech superstars in person! Talking with the people who shape the technologies we work with and love every day is a very unique experience. For example, I had the opportunity to ask Thomas Wuerthinger about the implementation details of his submission to win \"The One Billion Row Challenge\" [1].

        "text": "Now is a good time to reflect upon my professional achievements in 2023.\n\nHere are some of my highlights from the year gone by:\n\n* Completed my PhD. I successfully delivered and defended my PhD thesis at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. This is a significant milestone for me after 5 years of dedicated research efforts.\n\n* Landed a great job at SEB. After about 30 job applications, 10 interviews, and a few attractive offers, I happily joined SEB. Now I‚Äôm convinced that I made the right choice. \n\n* Got a paper accepted at IEEE TSE. I submitted a research paper that got accepted in the journal  Transactions on Software Engineering. This achievement marked a peak in my research career.\n\n* Engaged with the tech community. I attended over 10 technical meetups in Stockholm. This allowed me to connect with the tech community while visiting companies such as Google, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Spotify, Cloudera, Goldman Sachs,  Combient, and more. I also contributed as a volunteer at Jfokus. \n\n* Expanded my online presence. I wrote 10 blog posts on my website, spoke at 4 events, and was featured in a podcast episode for the first time.\n\n* Kept learning. I improved my Swedish significantly, completed 3 specializations on Coursera, read around 10 technical books, and listened to all episodes of the \"Lex Friedman Podcast\" and \"Software Engineering Radio.\"\n\n* Committed to fitness. I maintained a steady gym routine, hitting the gym at least 5 times a week, and ran the Blodomloppet Sverige (10km Stockholm‚Äôs half marathon). There is no professional growth without good health, which for me means going to the gym regularly üòÄ\n\nFor the next year, my professional focus is to create more technical content (inc. source code) and consume less content in general. \n\nWishing everyone a Happy New Year! Let's make 2024 a year of growth and achievement.\n\n#highlights2023 #newyear2024  #happynewyear #newyearresolution",

If your answer is \"yes\", think twice because most people don't.\n\nTo answer this question, the idea of building Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) has recently emerged as a key concept to enable principled engineering of software supply chains. It extends the well-established concept of a \"bill of materials\", used in manufacturing physical goods, to the realm of software development. The purpose of SBOMs is to capture relevant information about the internals of a software artifact. This includes a complete inventory of all the third-party dependencies of the artifact and its build environment. Thus, answering the question regarding third-party code provenance.\n\nWhether you‚Äôre a Java security expert or just starting your journey to deploy robust software solutions, this session is for you. We'll delve into checksums, hierarchy, reproducibility, and production steps for SBOM producers. Let's unleash the benefits of using SBOMs to harden the software supply chain of real-world #Java projects! \n\nMore info and registration: buff.ly/3Sd3GjR",
