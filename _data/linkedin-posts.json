        "text": "I’ve no doubt that the job market is not easy for entry level devs right now.\n\nI meet brilliant students at local meetups quite often. Many of them are really struggling to get their first job offer.\n\nIt's clear that they all can code, they’ve the skills, but when I ask about how the skills are packaged, I realize they’re missing the opportunity to show actual value.\n\nThis is what I tell them:\n\n👉 You’re not selling coding abilities anymore. You’re selling business outcomes.\n\nSo don’t make the mistake of emphasizing your raw skills as before:\n\n❌ “I can code in Python”\n❌ “I know React”\n❌ “I build APIs”\n\nThat’s the fastest way to become a commodity, or worse: perceived as potentially replaceable by some increasingly powerful AI.\n\nThe thing is, businesses don’t care how many programming languages or frameworks you know.\n\nThey only care about one single thing: business value (a.k.a. revenue).\n\nIf you somehow manage to position yourself as a problem-solver providing a specialized service, everything changes:\n\n✅ You stop selling your hours\n✅ You start showing your impact\n✅ You command respect (and higher pay, obviously)\n\nHere are three examples:\n\n1️⃣ Instead of “I know React and Node.js” you would say “I help SaaS companies increase user sign-ups by 25% through better onboarding flows”. \n\n2️⃣ Instead of “I build APIs” you would say “I optimize checkout systems to reduce cart abandonment by 30%”. \n\n3️⃣ Instead of “I know TensorFlow and scikit-learn” you would say “I know how to develop ML models that save banks millions in losses”. \n\nAgain, most companies don’t care about architecture patterns or code quality, unfortunately.\n\nThey're only ready to bet on growth, efficiency, and solutions to painful problems.\n\nBecome the specialist who fixes the pain they can’t ignore.\n\nThat’s how you’ll win 😉",

        "text": "Agentic frameworks didn’t evolve into a necessity, they exploded into one. \n\nToday, they are becoming as foundational to AI development as Kubernetes is to cloud computing.\n\nBack in 2014, when Kubernetes launched, cloud computing was chaos.\n\nCompanies were deploying containerized apps across multiple environments, each with different APIs, configs, and deployment models. Managing them manually was practically impossible.\n\nThen Kubernetes came along, as a single orchestrator to abstract away the pain and completely reshape the cloud ecosystem.\n\nFast forward to today: we’re at the same inflection point with LLMs.\n\nAgentic frameworks promise to do for AI what Kubernetes did for cloud:\n\n• Orchestrate reasoning\n• Manage tool usage\n• Handle human feedback loops\n• Schedule tasks\n• Bridge the gap from chat to action\n\nAs Kubernetes does, they orchestrate complex systems by managing tasks, resources, and feedback loops at scale.\n\nOn top of that, agentic frameworks also also make debugging, evaluating, and benchmarking AI-driven apps far easier.\n\nThe ecosystem is exploding: LangChain, OpenAI’s Agents SDK, Google ADK, NVIDIA’s NeMo, Hugging Face smolagents, deepset's Haystack… you name it.\n\nBut I still hear some developers asking the same couple of questions:\n\nWhy do we even need them?\nIsn’t it all just about calling model APIs?\n\nMy answer:\n\nNot anymore. Calling GPT-5 or Claude directly is like deploying containers manually on bare-metal servers. Sure, it works, until a vendor introduces a breaking API change. As AI agents grow more complex, we need orchestration: coordinating tools, chaining tasks, injecting guardrails, and managing context across systems.\n\nSo the most popular frameworks are not just connecting APIs, they are defining the standards of how LLM-powered systems reason, act, and scale.\n\nTech battles are heating up at every corner of the AI field 🍿\n\nWhich framework do you think will end up dominating the market?",

Sweden beats them despite its size.\n\nOther surprises:\n\n◾️ The U.S. → 4% of the world’s population, 26% of GDP… still holds ~50% of all stock market value!\n\n◾️ Switzerland → 0.1% of the world’s population, 0.01% of GDP… still controls ~2% of listed stocks!\n\nThe takeaway?\n\n👉 Innovation, capital markets, and global brands matter more than size.\n\nWhat do you think makes Sweden’s performance so competitive?\n\nWhat would it take for Sweden to reach Switzerland’s level and become a top 10?\n\nP.S.

He told me stories of how tiny, unexpected phenomena could bring down massive projects, like the London Millennium Bridge in 2000, shaken by a new vibration effect later called “synchronous lateral excitation.”\n\nI believe we’re at a similar turning point in software engineering.\n\nLLMs are forcing us into the world of non-determinism and uncertainty that other engineering fields have faced for millennia.\n\nI remember when non-determinism hit my \"product software\" for the first time:\n\nEarly in my career, I built a feature and every test case passed perfectly on my computer. But in the client’s PC the app triggered a weird error half the time for no apparent reason. I assumed I’d made a mistake. But no, it was the noise of reality injecting variability I hadn’t accounted for. Back then, those situations were rare, and I was both confused and frustrated.\n\nI expected my code to behave deterministically, all the time! (yeah, I didn’t have much experience 20 years ago).\n\nNow, with LLMs, unpredictability is the assumption rather than the exception.\n\nAnd as engineers, we shouldn’t be surprised, because most other engineering disciplines already take variability very seriously:\n\n✓ Process engineers design systems knowing humans make mistakes.\n✓ Structural engineers account for forces they can’t measure or fully predict.\n✓ Biomedical engineers design devices knowing they’ll behave differently in every patient.\n\nSoftware engineering, though, has always been perceived as different.\n\nOur machines were deterministic: the same input produced the same output, almost always.\n\nLLMs just broke that fantasy. Two identical prompts can yield completely different answers.\n\nDeterminism is gone, and with it, the old certainty of how software “should” behave.\n\nThe shift isn’t optional. \n\nIf we want to thrive in the age of AI, we must learn to engineer for unpredictability, by default.\n\nLike with bridges, our software now has to sway with the wind, or risk collapsing under forces we didn’t plan for at first.",

        "text": "Good friends have asked me how I manage to type so fast without even looking at the keyboard.\n\nThe secret is touch typing.\n\nIt’s a skill I learned more than 20 years ago (ouch, I just felt old after writing this line).\n\nBack then, I used a small Windows XP app that taught me the basics. Today, you can find a modern version called TIPP10.\n\nAfter just a couple of days of practice, I was already typing without glancing.\n\nThe trick to mastering this is to follow the Ten-Finger System.\n\nHere’s the basic idea:\n\n① Place your left-hand fingers on A, S, D, F and your right-hand fingers on J, K, L. Thumbs rest on the space-bar.\n\n② Each finger is responsible for specific keys (see the attached figure below for a precise finger-to-key mapping).\n\n③ Always return to the home row after pressing any key.\n\n④ Focus on the text, not the keyboard. This helps you spot typos immediately.\n\n⑤ Accuracy comes first. Speed naturally improves with practice.\n\nThis system saves time because you don’t have to constantly shift from the screen to the keyboard and back again (added bonus: you can see mistakes as they happen on the screen).\n\nFor me, the time invested was really worth it, considering that I’ve benefited from it all my life.\n\nBut… does typing faster make any difference?\n\nHonestly, not always. As a software developer, I spend more time reading code and THINKING than actually typing. But when you do need to write quickly, it’s incredibly handy, e.g. when I'm chatting, emailing, or writing a random LinkedIn post about touch typing 😁\n\nIf you want to try it out for free, here’s a link to TIPP10: https://www.tipp10.com\n\nP.S. Having a good keyboard also contributes to type faster, and I’m a huge mechanical keyboard nerd. I’ve built my own keyboards piece by piece, customized keycaps, hand-lubed switches, etc. But… that’s content for another post.",

        "text": "In a world where AI can answer, summarize, explain, and predict, I think the game isn’t about acquiring knowledge. It’s knowing what to ask and how to execute on top of it.\n\nThe current situation is nothing new. Let’s look a bit into history.\n\nIn 1440, Johannes Gutenberg introduced the printing press.\n\nSuddenly, Europe experienced an explosion of information. For the first time in history, books weren’t scarce artifacts chained to monastery walls. Books became cheap, abundant, and widely accessible.\n\nWithin a few decades, anyone who could read had access to the same texts: Aristotle, Euclid, the Bible, and scientific treatises. Knowledge stopped being a privilege of the elite.\n\nHowever…\n\nMost people didn’t become groundbreaking thinkers overnight just because they had access to more information. They were flooded with answers but lacked the skills to think out of the box and ask the right questions.\n\nMeanwhile, a few guys like Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler made groundbreaking achievements.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause they challenged assumptions:\n\n🔹 What if the Earth isn’t the center of the universe?\n🔹 What if gravity explains planetary motion?\n\nThese weren’t answers to those hidden in books. They were original questions no one else dared to ask. There was no existing knowledge about it.\n\nFast forward to today: AI is our modern printing press. We all have access to the same “answering machine.” And the real differentiator isn’t knowing more, it’s knowing what to ask, how to squeeze LLMs, and how to extrapolate from the answers it gives to us.\n\nIndeed, I believe that the art of questioning is becoming more and more relevant with AI:\n\n✓ Great questions unlock better AI responses.\n✓ They spark deeper (more human-like) conversations.\n✓ They lead to better decisions, faster.\n\nIn my latest blog post, I rambled on about the techniques, patterns, and anti-patterns I've discovered about asking better questions.

        "text": "What if LinkedIn loses every single post you’ve ever written? Years of ideas. Gone. I’ve realized that we don’t actually own what we publish here! So, I built a solution.\n\nOne of my biggest problems with content platforms and social media is ownership.\n\nFor years, I’ve seen the rise and fall of websites where people created content for free (e.g., Google+, Twitter, Medium, and StackOverflow), and later, the content is lost for whatever reason, making it impossible to look back and search through your own ideas.\n\nSharing valuable insights demands a significant amount of effort. What if the platform changes its policies or just shuts down? Let me say this again: all your content would be gone in an instant.\n\nSo, how do we avoid this?\n\nWe could publish on our own websites, but that often comes at the cost of losing a large chunk of potential reach. After all, the big audiences are on social platforms these days.\n\nI decided to take an alternative approach:\n\n👉 I’ll keep posting on LinkedIn, but store the metadata of all my posts on my personal website and render them there.\n\nI built a solution together with my friends Cursor and Claude that automatically fetches the data and renders it statically.\n\nEverything runs fully automatic on GitHub Actions, like magic!\n\nThe flow is as follows:\n\n1️⃣ Every Monday morning, a GitHub Action fetches all the LinkedIn posts I published the previous week (inc. images) using a REST API. It then appends those new post entries to a JSON file located in my website’s repository on GitHub and commits & pushes the changes there.\n\n2️⃣ My website reads that JSON file at build time and renders each LinkedIn post. I even added filters to sort posts by date, reactions, and comments for easy analytics.\n\nNow, for instance, this post will live in two places:\n\n🔹 On LinkedIn, where it reaches most people.\n🔹 On my website, where I truly own it.\n\nNo more worrying about losing years of ideas.\nNo more dependence on a single platform.\n\nMy content persists in a JSON file that I can port, process, and manipulate however I want.\n\nDid you like the idea?\n\n—\n\nGitHub Action → https://lnkd.in/dsNRSNYB\nJSON file → https://lnkd.in/dX7ywZR4\nRendered posts → https://lnkd.in/d5u5g2Et\n\nP.S. This is my 100th LinkedIn post this year, and I know it thanks to my own analytics 😉",

        "text": "Having a hard time figuring out what’s going on in a bunch of Python error logs? Feeling lost in the traceback?\n\nSpending a lot of time staring at console logs looking for runtime edge cases is a common thing. No dev can escape from it, especially now that understanding AI outputs is so critical.\n\nAnd you’re right, the Python compiler still has a lot of room for improvement when it comes to developer experience.\n\nThe underlying reason is that the Python compiler intentionally defers many checks to runtime. The upside is speed of iteration, the downside is that you discover certain mistakes only when the buggy instruction is executed.\n\nIt’s just an issue in Python that we all have to deal with.\n\nIs there a solution?\n\nNot really, but you can use libraries that enhance the debugging experience.\n\nIn particular, I’ve been using a Python library called “rich” lately for this purpose.\n\nRich adds custom colors, formatting, and metadata to the logs, making issue tracking an entirely different experience for developers.\n\nWant an enhanced traceback?\n\nJust import `install` from `rich.traceback` and run `install()` in the beginning of your script (see example below 👇). \n\nIt makes errors clearer in the console by pretty-printing and pointing directly to the line that triggered the error.\n\nRich also offers a nice way to display the value of local variables in functions, very useful for debugging!\n\nTry it out, you’ll see… going back to raw logs will feel like a “no way, dude.”\n\nLink to the library → https://lnkd.in/diGRzGeg",

        "text": "Yesterday, I ran the Midnattsloppet race in Stockholm and finally broke a mark I’ve been chasing for years, improving my personal record for this race by more than one minute.\n\nMidnattsloppet has never been easy for me. For 3 years in a row, I tried to finish under 50 minutes. Last year I was very close, but not quite there.\n\nI feel the challenge real. Thousands of runners fill the streets, and the long uphill stretch between km 3 and km 4.3 drains my legs and tests willpower.\n\nAt around km 5, I seriously considered slowing to a walk. But instead, I adjusted my pace and kept moving forward.\n\nAt that moment, I reminded of something bigger.\nWe all face situations where giving up seems like the easier path. We come up with excuses and so on. The temptation comes fast, often disguised as “just take a break.” But every time we reject it, something changes inside us. That’s where actual growth happens.\n\nFor me, running 10k races isn’t just physical exercise, it’s a way to train my resilience to overcome such moments of flakyness. Every step strengthens not only the legs and lungs, but also the mind, teaching me to push through adversity no matter how tough it feels.\n\nIf you haven’t tried it, I highly recommend finding an activity that does the same for you. Physical challenges are an incredible way to train consistency and resilience, for both body and mind.\n\nP.S. A big thank to SEB for providing and maintaining an excellent gym on prems. It has made a real difference in life quality for me and many other employees.",

If I wanted to read good stuff, I had to walk to the local library and sit down there to read.\n\nWhen I was 20, I remember that university professors were respected for the sheer amount of knowledge they had accumulated over a lifetime. We valued them because their skills and expertise were scarce.\n\nNow, in my 30s, knowledge is everywhere. It’s cheaper than ever and moves at lightspeed. A curious 10-year-old today can access cutting-edge tools and learn from the latest research papers, from home!\n\nEveryone can now prompt an AI assistant for free. This has optimized knowledge search ever more.\n\nOn the other hand, AI is currently making businesses ruthlessly efficient at applying existing knowledge, which also means fewer people are needed to do those jobs.\n\nHowever, current AI models still struggle to apply, synthesize, and adapt existing knowledge to create something genuinely new.\n\nSo, I would say that in an era of abundant existing knowledge, the ability to create new knowledge represents the real competitive edge.\n\nThe perceived value of those people pushing the boundaries of human knowledge must increase accordingly (e.g., researchers building foundational models, redefining computer vision, inventing the next generation of robotics, etc.) \n\nCompanies should start valuing more the work of those pushing the limits of science.\n\nAs a former academic researcher, I see this as overdue recognition for the countless PhD students who’ve been grinding away for years in low-reward conditions.\n\nNature doesn’t like imbalance. It always finds a way of evening things out.\n\nLooking forward to witnessing this new era! 😊",

Nothing.\n\nI only bring a book (or two).\n\nBreaking free from my (our?) digital dependence is a transformative experience.\n\nI get the chance to feel nature, throw stones into the water with my little child, and slow down from the relentless pace of modern society.\n\nNo pressure, no deadlines, nothing that needs to be quickly accomplished.\n\nI can’t emphasize enough how powerful this is for body and mind. \n\nJust a few examples of benefits:\n\n→ I am present for my family without having to consciously plan for it.\n\n→ I have time to reflect on life’s simplicity and savor its best moments.\n\n→ I break free from the home ↔ work loop and live real-life experiences.\n\nI’ve also noticed year after year how it gets harder to stay disconnected in a society that relies more and more on the internet, and the fact that everyone carries a computer brick in their pocket.\n\nI believe that in the near future, there will be “digital-free” spaces where people can socialize the old-fashioned way and experience these benefits. It might even become a big business, catering to the wealthy.\n\nAre you “rich enough” to try a full 7-day digital detox?\n\nP.S.

Documentation\n2. Environment setup and maintenance\n3. Writing and maintaining tests\n4. Task tracking and backlog management\n5. Security and compliance\n\nThe takeaway: \n\nThere are huge opportunities to create great AI products for developers beyond coding tools.",

You just flip it to set 5, 10, 30, or 60 minutes.\n\nIt works!\n\nThis little thing is a real productivity booster because:\n\n1️⃣ We are all pretty bad at estimating how long it takes to complete most tasks.\n\n2️⃣ Lazy people (like me) often need a kicker to pick up the right pace and keep momentum.\n\n3️⃣ Having no time for anything else allows me to focus for short periods of time on a SINGLE task.\n\nHere are my two favorite ways to use it:\n\n✅ To gamify tiny tasks under strict time constraints:\n→ e.g., I gave myself a max of 10 minutes to write this LinkedIn post.**\n\n✅ To get deep focus time without interruptions:\n→ e.g., I can agree with the family not to be disturbed for, say, 1h, and everyone can see the timer counting down.\n\nGive it a try!\n\n* Productivity and the “amount of things done” are very subjective matters, so whatever metric works for you is probably right.\n\n** I already had in mind what this post would be about (that’s another trainable mental process for which I’ve developed some other tactics), and I spent 1 extra min taking the picture.",

I enjoy it as much as I did years ago with GoT🍿\n\nIn yesterday’s episode, uhm, I mean… talk by Andrew Ng “Building Faster with AI,” he mentioned something interesting:\n\n👉 “With AI coding assistants, rapid engineering has become possible in a way that wasn’t possible before, so the speed of engineering is going up rapidly and the (engineering) cost is also going down very fast.”\n\nBut there's a difference.\n\nSuch speed gains heavily depend on the type of application being developed:\n\n• For prototypes → 10x faster!\n• For production software → 30–50% faster?\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause standalone prototypes have:\n\n1. Far less integration with legacy systems, and  \n2. Much lower requirements for reliability, scalability, and security.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\n• For entrepreneurs → You can now build (with AI) 10x more prototypes to see what works.\n• For dev employees → You should focus on working directly with production systems.\n• For everyone → You can now move fast while being responsible.\n\nSoftware development has never been this fast, and will never be this slow again.\n\nLink to Andrew's talk:\n⤷ https://lnkd.in/dE7X3hyE",

Do its leaders understand how AI works and the immense potential it holds?\n\nThis morning at SEB, I found something in the entrance: \"The Essential AI Handbook for Leaders,” a compact yellowish book that tackles these questions head-on.\n\nIt covers:\n\n① The fundamentals of AI and how it works.\n② The potential of AI and how it can be applied in business and society.\n③ How AI can be operationalized in an organization to rise performance to new levels.\n\nI read it all.\n\nThe message for leaders is crystal clear:\n\n👉 The more you learn about AI now, the better your chances of being among the first to benefit from it.\n\nAs Marcus Wallenberg put it:\n\n“At the end of the day, it is not technology that creates success, it is people. It is leaders who make the right decisions based on accurate data, sharp insights, and their ability to work with the best talent. Those who do this faster than the competition will succeed.\"\n\n__\n\nAI will impact us all.\n\nGet to know it, and your own path forward.\n\nThe first step toward change is insight and knowledge.\n\nThis may be the first time in history when understanding and using a tool could matter more than building it.\n\nI’m glad that my current employer is on the right track when it comes to AI 🚀",

        "text": "Watched François Collet's talk: \"How We Get to AGI\" tonight with great interest. He presented unique insights based on years of research creating scientific benchmarks for measuring AI’s intelligence.\n\nMy takeaway:\n\n\"As long as we can easily come out with tasks that are easy for humans, but that AI can’t figure out, we don’t have AGI yet.\"\n\nMy notes:\n\n🔹 Fluid intelligence:\n⤷ It doesn’t emerge from pretraining and scaling GPT models.\n\n🔹 Test-Time Adaptation (TTA):\n⤷ It has dramatically improved model capabilities, but it’s still not AGI.\n\n🔹 What is intelligence, anyway? \n⤷ Intelligence is a process, not to be confused with \"skill\", which is the output of that process. So, intelligence is the ability to deal with new situations.\n\n🔹 What is AGI, then?\n⤷ We shouldn’t define AGI as a system that can perform 80% of economically valuable tasks. Instead, true AGI would be a system that can learn new skills efficiently and solve previously unseen problems.\n\nIn the end, Collet shares his current work on building a new kind of AI model capable of extrapolating NEW solutions using a “library” of previously discovered abstractions.\n\nIn his view, the ultimate goal of AGI isn’t automation. It’s to accelerate scientific progress.\n\nOverall, a remarkable talk by a brilliant scientist.\n\n* I personally don’t believe Collet's suite of interactive video games is the best way for determining whether we've reached AGI.\n\nMy favorite slide 👇",

        "text": "The media is now buzzing about Meta's Superintelligence Labs and Zuckerberg’s \"secret list” of elite #AI PhDs, reportedly receiving offers around $100M.\n\nWhat’s interesting to me: \n⤷ Never before have a handful of PhD researchers been valued so highly. For comparison, $100M is roughly twice NBA superstar LeBron James’s base salary in 2025.\n\nBut...\n\n→ How much is that price tag in the grand scheme of things?\n→ How does anyone could measure the true value of a human brain?\n\nAs a PhD graduate, let me share 5 thoughts on this:\n\n1️⃣ We now have incredibly powerful AI models, but building them depends on a very small circle of top-tier minds (now in their 30s) who were working in obscure, undervalued research areas just a few years ago.\n\n2️⃣ Meta isn’t simply paying for researchers, it’s paying for battle-tested, experimental experience in building and deploying LLMs at scale.\n\n3️⃣ For Meta and other companies of similar size, $100M is just a fraction of what’s invested in AI infrastructure, such as GPU data centers.\n\n4️⃣ We still don’t know whether this talent race will drive new breakthroughs or merely concentrate intellectual power in a few corporate labs.\n\n5️⃣ This isn’t good news for the traditional academic system. PhD graduates deserve high pay, top talent eill flood into Big Tech, chasing billions instead of papers and teaching.\n\nEither way, what a time to be fitting tensors and orchestrating agents! \n\nI wish I had done my PhD in NLP a decade ago :/\n\nOnce again, the future proves unpredictable 🔮",

It’s fragmented, noisy, and constantly in constant motion.\n\nHowever, most data scientists don’t actually work with real-world data. Bridging the gap between development and production requires a shift in mindset and tooling.\n\nSo, how to level up?\n\n✅ Learn distributed computing:\n⤷  Use PySpark, Dask, or SQL engines like BigQuery\n⤷  Operate with scale as the default assumption\n\n✅ Think like an engineer:\n⤷  Design DAGs. Build pipelines. Automate every step\n⤷  Treat the model as just one component in a larger system\n\n✅ Go beyond notebooks:\n⤷  Dockerize workflows. Orchestrate with Airflow or Prefect\n⤷  Integrate with CI/CD pipelines and monitoring\n\nAgain, true impact starts when we reach production. When our ML models meet the live, messy, massive, beautiful chaos of the real world.\n\nLet’s plug them in 🔌",

        "text": "I've watched the recent talk “Software in The Era of AI” by Andrej Karpathy at Y Combinator many times now.\n\nWith 1M+ views on YT, it’s one of the best #AI talks I’ve seen for a general audience.\n\nIn ~40 minutes, Andrej distills the current trajectory of AI in a way that’s clear, engaging, and inspiring.\n\nI've recommended it to many friends, and now I find myself asking:\n⤷ What makes this talk exceptional?\n⤷ What can we learn from the speaker?\n\nHere’s what I think makes it superb:\n✓ He seems genuinely excited about the topic, positive, and has open body language.\n✓ He shares personal work along the way (tweets, posts, photos, and anecdotes), building trust and authenticity.\n✓ He speaks in 1st person, sharing opinions and reflections (“I think…”), which makes it feel personal.\n✓ He uses analogies and real-world examples constantly, e.g., when calling LLMs a new kind of OS.\n✓ He structures his talk into clear sections, recapping each one to reinforce key ideas.\n✓ His slides alternate between big, bold visuals and simple, centered headlines.\n✓ Most importantly, his tone stays hopeful throughout. Even when discussing limitations, he keeps the vibe optimistic.\n\nBelow is a more detailed breakdown of his flow ↓\n\nIntro:\n• Begins with enthusiasm and gratitude for being there.\n• Remarks on the title and explains why the topic matters.\n• Frames the big question: Why is software changing so fast?\n• Provides a historical perspective: Software 1.0 → 2.0 → 3.0.\n• Uses concrete examples to highlight his key observation.\n\nPart 1: Software Evolution\n• Quotes Andrew Ng: AI is the new electricity.\n• Explains the analogy with real-life examples (e.g., factories → software).\n• Adds his twist: \"LLMs are like a new OS.\"\n• Introduces a counterintuitive idea: We have a new magical computer helping us boil eggs.\n• Summarizes Part 1 with bullet points.\n\nPart 2: The Psychology of LLMs\n• Dives a bit into the internals of LLMs (transformers).\n• Acknowledges their current limitations.\n• Recommends sci-fi movies as a gift to the audience.\n• Summarizes Part 2 with images.\n\nPart 3: New Opportunities\n• Offers a new abstraction: LLMs as the GUIs for machine intelligence.\n• Gives real examples of current successes (e.g., Cursor).\n• Poses the big question: What will future apps look like?\n• Weaves analogies and personal stories (how he uses LLMs, how he “keeps AI on a leash,” his first Waymo ride, etc).\n• Shows an emotional video of kids vibe coding (going emotional with a hopeful vision).\n• Ends Part 3 with his vibe-coded app experiments and areas still unexplored (this opens up for the next final section)\n\nPart 4: Building for Agents\n• Makes a bold prediction: We’re entering a new era of digital “agents.”\n• Imagines future human–AI interaction.\n• Introduces upcoming tools and possibilities.\n\nFinal Summary:\n• Displays a collage of key slides tying everything together into a single storyline.\n\nOverall, an extremely well-packaged talk ✨\nShould we try to replicate this framework?",

        "text": "There was a time when I believed I just needed to push myself harder. Grind longer. Power through the fatigue.\n\nAll I needed, I thought, was “just one more research paper,” “just one more OSS project,” “just one more thing to prove to myself,” and so on…\n\nThis kind of self-pressure often drained me, but I was younger and could afford the late nights.\n\nToday, I need to be more mindful of my capacity.\n\nI’ve learned that willpower isn’t an infinite resource, and that the best long-term strategy is to dose it wisely.\n\nMotivation doesn’t fail because we’re weak. It fails because it runs out. \n\nJust like a muscle, our willpower gets depleted after use, and pretending it doesn’t only makes the crash harder.\n\nAnd if you feel like me, most of the time the problem isn’t actually depletion, it’s refusing to refuel.\n\nEnergy is a limited resource that can easily be drained.\n\nLooking into it, I found a 2008 study that showed people who rested just 10 minutes between demanding tasks recovered completely, while others stayed depleted.\n\nSo the next time you can’t focus, procrastinate, or lose control, don’t shame yourself. \n\nYour tank could be empty. What you need isn’t more discipline. You need a break that actually refuels you.\n\nRelaxing isn’t the same as cheering up. It’s not about just “feeling good”, it’s about slowing down. \n\nStop thinking\nNo cellphone\nQuiet\nStillness\nDoing nothing on purpose\n\nSo, I’ve stopped blaming myself when I’m drained.\n\nEvery time I’m exhausted, I tell myself: “Running on empty doesn’t make you strong, it actually makes you stuck.”\n\nYou’ll never hit rock bottom again if you learn to pause before the crash 🧘",

        "text": "The real risk with AI is not that it sometimes produces wrong outputs. It’s that we still don’t know when (or where) it will.\n\nIn 2023, researchers from Harvard University, MIT Professional Education, The Wharton School, and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) ran experiments with 758 consultants using GPT‑4 and identified an invisible boundary.\n\nThey called it the \"Jagged Frontier\". The inability of LLMs to deal the same way with tasks with the same level of complexity for a human. \n\nWhat did they found?\n\nWhen tasks matched GPT‑4’s strengths:\n✅ +40% in quality, +25% faster execution, +12% more output\n\nBut when tasks didn’t:\n❌ A 19% drop in efficiency \n\nFair enough :/ But what's the real issue?\n\nThe problem is that most people couldn’t tell when they’d crossed the line:\n\n👉 “On some tasks AI is immensely powerful, and on others it fails completely or subtly. And unless you use AI a lot, you won’t know which is which.”\n\nOkay, that was 2 years ago. Today…\n\nAI systems are adapting: adding guardrails, evals, decision triggers, and human oversight.\n\nThe frontier is beginning to blur, not because LLMs are flawless, but because our systems for working with them are getting better.\n\nWe’re entering a new agentic phase by:\n\n✓ Mapping workflows → e.g., aligning AI strengths with task complexity\n✓ Building guardrails → e.g., audit trails, explainable outputs, confidence thresholds\n✓ Upskilling humans → e.g., at prompt design, uncertainty detection, human-in-the-loop orchestration\n\nI believe there is great potential in having models that know when to pause, ask, and let humans decide, completely flattering the line. \n\nAsk yourself:\nWhere are the jagged edges in your current workflow?\n\nTbh, it's getting harder for me to figure this one out 😄",

But turning those ideas into real, production-grade systems is not straightforward.\n\nTo move from idea to impact, each use case needs a clear (positive) response to each of the following questions, in that particular order:\n\n✔️ What’s the value?\n✔️ What about risks and ethics?\n✔️ Do we have the data?\n✔️ Are we tech-ready?\n✔️ Can we iterate (at scale)?\n\nHere is the recorded session:\n⤷ https://lnkd.in/dXar3T83\n\n👌🏻 Thanks to the organizers Mattias Karlsson, Jeanne Göthberg, and the AI-fokus team for such an awesome experience.",

Below are my thoughts from what I saw there ↓\n\n1️⃣ The cloud giants have gone all-in on AI.\n\nRapid customer acquisition and marketing are often high priorities in the early stages of disruptive technologies. The race is on. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are aggressively positioning their clouds as AI-first platforms. These cloud providers have the competitive advantage of already having the necessary infrastructure to create AI-native cloud services. For them, it’s a numbers game 💸\n\n2️⃣ Yet, no mind-blowing innovation on the sight.\n\nWith Gemini 2.5 Pro, one can write JavaScript frontend, Java backend, and Terraform IaC in natural language without leaving the platform. It can now feed all your company data into its context window and answer questions about it. But we already knew it would be just a matter of time before this happened. The question is: what else? Personally, I would like to see new use cases. For example, a new type of AI-powered product integrated in a way that I could really use in my daily life, beyond the well-known chatbot-styled UI (maybe an AI-native hardware device would be interesting) 🕹️\n\n3️⃣ For devs, AI is a double-edged productivity boost. \n\nOn-cloud AI code assistants will change how we create and deploy apps. There’s truly no going back to handwriting code from scratch anymore. I wonder if there is any chance for local AI-powered IDEs when these cloud providers have all the context integrated... I don’t know, but for the time being, AI is being sold as the perfect way to “experiment quickly, build agentic experiences, shift down, use AI assistance, and become wildly more productive,” hmm 🙄 \n\nMy last takeaway: Move faster. Build smarter. Offload to an AI the grunt work. Ship on the cloud like never before. Tomorrow, we don’t know.\n\nOverall, a well-organized and worthwhile event to attend.\n\nPS. When it comes to good food and entertainment, Google truly knows how to deliver 😎",

        "text": "Yesterday, I participated in the Google Cloud AI Hackathon, held to celebrate the launch of its cloud region in Sweden. I tried vibe-coding a Firebase app without writing a single LoC myself. Below are 7 thoughts that crossed my mind during the day ↓\n\n1️⃣ Everyone should learn how to use AI to build software. I mean EVERYONE, no excuses. If you haven’t tried yet… what are you waiting for?\n\n2️⃣ The best (and probably only) way to understand AI’s impact on software development is by playing with it and trying as many tools as you can. I guess you already know the benefits, limits, and ideal use cases of the most popular ones… do you?\n\n3️⃣ Having access to an AI-driven cloud ecosystem speeds things up a lot. You can build a full working prototype from (clear) idea to deployment in a few hours just by prompting Gemini 2.5. It is capable of orchestrating the cloud-native components like a boss! This makes me wonder... will app development outside agentic private clouds soon feel obsolete?\n\n4️⃣ Most of the participants were quite young. I’d estimate the average age was under 30, and some winners weren’t even developers. Are more seasoned professional devs missing the AI r/evolution?\n\n5️⃣ Seeing these tools in action, and how insanely fast you can build with them, made me question everything. Do traditional dev practices, like SCRUM, do they even make sense anymore? Can we truly be “AI native” if we keep using workflows designed to harness lazy humans?\n\n6️⃣ One of the biggest mindset shifts I had was this: you don’t need to know everything to start building. With the right AI tools, you can learn while doing. Skipping hours of tutorials and docs. Does it even make sense to read tutorials anymore?\n\n7️⃣ Hackathons are such a great way to level up, connect with energetic folks, and get a front-row seat to the future. Seems like the new best way to get people involved, so there's a big opportunity there for everyone: Hackathons are the Bootcamps v2.0! \n\nAnyway, I’m thrilled #Sweden just became a Google Cloud hub in the Nordics! 🇸🇪🚀☁️",

But after trying Polars, there’s no turning back.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause Polars is blazing fast.\nIt’s built in Rust 🦀 and powered by Apache Arrow 🏹, giving it an edge that Pandas can’t match.\n\nPolars optimizes operations.\nLike Spark, it builds an execution graph and runs it only when needed, thanks to its lazy evaluation mechanism.\n\nAnyway, I was never comfortable with Pandas' syntax.\nPandas’ is imperative, Polars embraces a functional style → clean, expressive, and reminiscent of R’s tidyverse (yep, I was an R fanboy before Python took over data-verse).\n\nBut here’s what sealed the deal for me to use Polars:\n\n🔹Transformations return new objects by default, no side effects, no surprises.\n🔹It runs multi-threaded, utilizing every core without me lifting a finger.\n🔹It’s energy efficient, researchers recommend it over Pandas for large datasets.\n\nExperiments from an EASE 2024 paper show clear results:\n\n“Polars dramatically reduces execution time and energy use, especially on large Data Analysis Tasks (DATs).”\n \nFull paper here: https://lnkd.in/dR2aeh-d\n\nIf you’re still clinging to Pandas, ask yourself:\n\nWhy settle for slow, clunky libraries in a world that demands speed, clarity, and efficiency?\n\nChoose wisely, my friend 🐻‍❄️",

        "text": "GitHub just released a dataset to compare OSS collaborations between global economies, and it confirms something I’ve long suspected:\n\nThe EU is the world’s OSS workforce, whereas the US is the world’s OSS headquarter and largest beneficiary. \n\nThe inbound/outbound collaborator graphs make it clear 👇\n\n📥 Inbound → Who Receives?\n\nThe US sees a huge inflow. Developers worldwide contribute to US-owned repos. In contrast, the EU gets far fewer inbound contributions than it sends out.\n\n📤 Outbound → Who Gives?\n\nThe EU leads in outbound activity. EU devs contribute heavily to projects outside the region. The US contributes far less by comparison.\n\n⚖️ The imbalance is huge, meaning:\n\n↳ OSS gravity (forks, issues, PRs, and visibility) pulls toward the US, whereas EU projects don’t attract the same global attention.\n↳ The EU is a code contributor, not a code destination.\n↳ For the US, this leads to better sustainability, faster innovation, and more influence. \n↳ For the EU, it’s a strategic vulnerability, relying on OSS platforms it doesn’t control.\n↳ Key libraries and infrastructure are US-based, eroding EU digital sovereignty.\n↳ EU devs are working for free on US projects, efforts without royalties.\n\nThis tech power imbalance is worth fixing.\n\n🎯 Here’re three ways to start changing it:\n\n1. The EU should invest more on local OSS (tools, libraries, and specially AI frameworks).\n2. The EU should host and protect key projects within EU jurisdictions.\n3. The EU should create OSS alliances and Foundations, building contributor communities across EU countries. \n\nOn my view, this obviously isn’t a lack of talent. It’s a failure of platform and resources' ownership.\n\nYou build it 💻. You run it ⚡️. You earn from it 💰. That’s how it should be.\n\nSource: https://lnkd.in/dJRnE7Va\n\nP.S. The width of each stream in the graphs below represents the volume of git pushes and PRs from one economy to others. Wider = more collaboration flow. China (in blue), has similar inbound/outbound margins.",

Do you remember?\n\nThose days were truly amazing!\n\nIt's incredibly that we had the time (and the patience) to go over books from start to finish.\n\nWhenever I wanted to learn something new, I’d just grab a good one from a reputable source and start from scratch.\n\nA good thing I remember is that most books were created to teach \"why\" things worked, not just \"how.\" Step by step. Concept by concept.\n\nWe kept them on our shelves and the chapters in our minds, like mental maps we could revisit anytime.\n\nBut today?\n\n↳ Tech moves so fast that by the time you finish a book, it might already be outdated.\n\nWhy?\n\n↳ Because the levels of abstraction keep climbing. Everything is built on top of frameworks, libraries, or APIs that evolve overnight.\n\nAnd also now, with #LLMs, we just ask for what we need, right when we need it. No need to store the sources anymore.\n\nStill… I miss the feeling of quietly reading for the sake of it.\n\nThe feeling of having no pressure, no rush to build something asap.\n\nJust learning for fun... did it actually exist?\n\nReading books has become a luxury. That's it.\n\nA luxury for people who have the most valuable resource on earth: time.\n\nIf you’re one of them, enjoy 📖, because many of us have already succumbed to the LLMs 🤖\n\nP.S. Yes, there are still timeless classics every dev should read, you should know the ones ;)",

THat spontaneous 20 min conversation evolved into a long term research collaboration. We ended up writing a few papers together!\n\nIt's amazing how a genuine request for someone's insights can spark collaboration, innovation, and even friendships.\n\nNever underestimate the power of simply reaching out.\n\nGive it a try! 👋\n\nP.S.

How could anyone maintain this stuff?”\n\nIf you’ve been into software long enough, I’m 100% sure you’ve had this kind of feeling.\n\nBut over time, I’ve learned something:\n\n↳ When really complex systems work for real customers, even if they work imperfectly, that’s not something to take lightly.\n\nThe very fact that it has worked and survived the test of time is a huge achievement!\n\nBecause complex systems are always messy from the inside out.\n\nSIDE NOTE: You know what I mean, the complexity of software is such a fascinating thing, isn’t it? 😁\n\nThis complexity is the price we pay for solving real problems at scale.\n\nThere’s no way to escape from it.\n\nWe don’t eliminate complexity, we just move it around and hide it with abstractions. \n\nThat’s why I hesitate before touching legacy code that has quietly done its job for years.\n\nNow I only change old, battle-proven code when I absolutely must. Seriously.\n\nIf you're in doubt, remember Chesterton’s Fence: \n\n↳ “Don’t tear down a fence until you understand why it was built.”\n\nIn other words: “Don’t change what you don’t understand!”\n\nI know it's hard this days, with #AI tools, it’s easier than ever to refactor or rewrite code. The bar to start making changes has lowered down significantly. But there’s a danger in how quickly we forget why something exists. For example, AI doesn’t know that a function was built around a legal constraint, a performance hack, or a hard-learned production failure.\n\nMany disasters in software don’t come from bad intentions. They come from lack of context and/or ignoring history.\n\nNew leaders often arrive, find things “useless” or “broken,” and want to delete or change them without appreciating the journey it took other devs to get there.\n\nSo when entering into a new codebase, respect wildlife like a nice guest in your neighbor's house. Because we won’t be able to fully grasp the intricacies of an ecosystem at the first glance, and that’s why we tread lightly.\n\nLet me said it again, we should stop pretending complexity can be removed. I've seen so many failed attempts into this direction... I can't count.\n\nLet’s accept complexity, that’s all. \n\nGood engineers make sure they understand the past before trying to mess around with the present.\n\nLet’s respect wildlife, for our own survival! 🐟",

That problem has been effectively solved, much like how machine translation was solved with Transformers.\n\nNow, the real challenge is:\n→ Know what to build.\n→ Know how it should work.\n→ Know how to make it evolve.\n\nFor example, I can prompt an LLM to write code that ingests messages from a Kafka topic and stores them in a PostgreSQL DB.\n\nBut I still need to:\n→ Handle message deduplication and idempotency.\n→ Implement retries with exponential backoff on database failures.\n→ Design the storage schema to accommodate evolving message formats.\n\nClear thinking about design, data, performance, and maintenance is becoming the most valuable skill in tech.\n\nSo no, I’m not walking away from code.\n\nI’m doubling down on software design, distributed systems, and everything that makes software robust, maintainable, and scalable.\n\nCause if we know what we're doing, AI won't replace us, it'll just make us 100x more valuable.",

        "text": "I love knobs, buttons, and PBT keycaps.\nThere’s something deeply satisfying about that tactile feedback, ... like my fingers are really feeling the machines. \n\nBut two decades ago, we started replacing our lovely physical UX by something else (thanks, Apple for the iPhone). \nEverything shifted to flat, glowing digital keyboards in the name of \"productivity,\" \"more features,\" and \"more screen space.\"\n\nNow these screens are everywhere, even where it doesn't make any sense.\nTouchscreens on fridges, on my front door, on cars (thanks, Tesla). \nEven TVs have on-screen keyboards?!\n\nOh, I have to mention my Samsung TV here.\nIt forces me to search using a remote with no physical letters that only moves in four directions… typing one letter at a time 🤦‍♂️\n\nBut now #AI has arrived, finally.\n#LLMs promise to change everything.\nAnd the industry now wants to replace the digital keyboard with voice.\n\nBut sure, we’ve heard this before: Siri, Alexa, Google Home. Do you remember?\nThey never really took off.\n\nSo is natural language finally the future of UX?\n\nHonestly… I don’t think so.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it's inefficient, limited, and inconvenient.\n\n→ It’s inefficient because we think at thousands of words per minute but can only speak ~150. And unlike typing, you can’t easily go back and edit your words when speaking. That makes natural language interactions slow, error-prone, and frustrating.\n\n→ It’s limited because it's lossy and ambiguous. Structured commands are clear. Language is fuzzy. You say one thing, the machine hears another. And you enter a cycle of clarifications.\n\n→ It’s inconvenient because saying “Open a new tab” out loud when ⌘T does it instantly is nonsense. Not to mention that this doesn't work in public spaces. \n\nSo no, #LLMs won’t replace the mouse and keyboard.\nIt doesn't matter how good the models will get.\n\nWhen we’ll ditch them?\nIf you ask me, I think that'll happen when #AI can finally read our thoughts.\n\nBut that’s another story.\n\nFor now, I’ll keep enjoying the satisfying clack clack of my hand-modded mechanical keyboard ⌨️",

        "text": "Let me tell you a quick story about programming, chess, and what's been wrong with coding interviews for decades:\n\nIn my 1st year of grad school, I heard about programming contests. They sounded exciting, but I didn’t solved any problem (I didn't know how to code in 2009).\n\nBy 2nd year, I jumped in, competed in a local ACM-ICPC tournament and got hooked.\n\nNext year, I was solving problem after problem on online judges (got 1,000+ correct submissions) and went to the regionals. It felt like leveling up in a video game.\n\nBut something changed.\n\nThe deeper I went, the more I realized: this wasn’t fun anymore. It was like ches: to really excel, you have to dedicate your life to it (I love chess, btw). \n\nThat killed the joy.\n\nSo I stepped away.\n\nYears later, I entered the job market, and boom! Coding interviews (especially in big tech) were all about solving those kinds of ADA problems live, under extreme pressure.\n\nIt felt familiar. Too familiar…\n\nBut in this case there's a huge problem:\n\nSolving algorithm puzzles in 45 mins has nothing to do with writing clean, maintainable software in the real world.\n\nWorse, the system is really broken:\n\n↳ It rewards people who’ve memorized patterns, not those who solve real problems.\n↳ It filters out brilliant engineers who haven’t “Leetcoded enough.”\n↳ It creates a test that’s easy to fail.\n\nI understand that this test style is scalable, but I've seen senior engineers with PhDs and successful OSS projects spending weeks practicing LeetCode problems just to get past the first interview screen.\n\nPutting that much energy into riddles wasn’t that bad 20 years ago. But the world has changed a lot since then.\n\nToday’s #LLMs can solve most ACM-ICPC problems in seconds.\n\nI don't really see how this could be a good way to test the value of professionals.\n\nToday I read about undetectable apps that feeds GPT-powered answers during LeetCode-style online interviews, like the one created by Roy Lee.\n\nSo the system will collapse under its own weight (at least for its online mode). But honestly... I'm happy about it.\n\nIt’s finally time to kill programming-contest-style interviews for good.\n\nSo what should we do instead?\n\nHere are some alternatives that I believe actually reflect real skills:\n\n↳ Give a real-world business problem. Ask the candidate to design and implement a solution from scratch. Discuss trade-offs, architecture, and impact.\n↳ Show messy, buggy, insecure code. Ask what’s wrong, what’s risky, and how they’d fix it.\n↳ Give raw data. Ask them to build something that adds or creates business value.\n\nThe whole point should be to simulate the real job. Because the real job lives in the real world. And in the real world, there is #AI, whether we want it or not.\n\nSo, let’s stop testing people on fantasy skills.\n\nIf you have a different idea, let me know 🙂\n\nP.S. I wrote a blog post many years ago about how I trained for ACM-ICPC contests (LLMs didn’t exist back then), here's it → https://lnkd.in/dqhBvVEh",

        "text": "How can a large company like SEB foster innovation?\n\nThat was the question that my colleague Georg Schuppe addressed yesterday in the session: “SEBx: Innovate Beyond the Future.”\n\nI  very much agree with his vision: We need to be OK with trying new things and failing. \n\nThe blockers to innovation are common to all big companies:\n↳ Employees drowning in repetitive tasks.\n↳ Managers too busy to make it a priority.\n↳ Data locked behind inaccessible databases.\n↳ Brilliant ideas crushed by silence, slow decisions, or KPIs.\n\nThe result?\n↳ Stagnation wrapped in legacy systems.\n↳ Big dreams with no budget.\n↳ “Agile” in name only.\n\nSo how to break it out?\n\nI think we need to understand that innovation isn’t a fuzzy buzzword.\n\nIt’s a system!\n\nAnd systems must scale if designed correctly. \n\nMcKinsey & Company describes innovation based on three horizons:\n\n1. Core (Incremental change):\n↳ Defend and extend what already works.\n↳ For example, to create internal tools, automate existing processes, or make small improvements.\n\n2. Emerging (Disruptive change):\n↳ Build what’s next.\n↳ For example, SEB Embedded came from the idea of banking as a service, which wasn’t such a cool idea 10 years ago, it was a bet that paid off.\n\n3. Future (Transformational change):\n↳ Invent the unthinkable.\n↳ For example, 5 years ago, a superintelligent AI assistant in your pocket felt like sci-fi, today it is transforming multiple industries. \n\nSo...\n\nTo unlock Core innovation:\n↳ Give people time and basic resources.\n↳ Let them fix what’s broken in their daily work.\n↳ And reward those who dare to care.\n\nTo foster Emerging innovation:\n↳ Create a multidisciplinary ecosystem of experts.\n↳ Give them support from the business to prototype, test, and implement innovative concepts swiftly and effectively.\n↳ Let them move fast, fail publicly, and try again.\n\nTo pursue Future innovation:\n↳ Fund the long game.\n↳ Protect wild ideas from quarterly goals.\n↳ Empower your visionaries, not only to deliver, but also to dream.\n\nBecause…\n\nThe future doesn’t wait for a greenlight from leadership. It arrives, whether you’re ready or not.\n\nSo here's a question for you:\n\nDoes your company has built an innovation system? \n\nIf yes, 👏",

        "text": "I’ve heard a lot of hype about the new ChatGPT-4o image generation model, so I decided to test it with one simple task:\n\n\"To remove the green background from an uploaded close-up picture of mine and replace it with a pure black background.\"\n\nThat’s it. No fancy edits. Just background removal.\n\nI tried multiple prompts. Tweaked the wording. Iterated many times on the pictures asking to only change the background, and repeated the process.\n\nEvery result failed.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the generated images didn’t look like me.\n\nThe differences were subtle: slightly off eyes, jawline, weird teeth, or unreal skin tone. Yet, they were enough to break the illusion (down below is the best result I got 👇).\n\nHere’s the problem: the model has never seen me before.\n\nUnless you’re a public figure, an actor, a politician, or someone with a massive online presence (i.e., online pictures) these models can only guess.\n\nSo, the current limitations of current AI models aren't the models themselves. It’s the training data!\n\nSo, the next time you deploy a #GenAI solution in production, remember this:\n\nWithout the right data, even the smartest model could fly blind 🙈",

AI is a productivity multiplier, not a replacement for human expertise.\n\nFor the over-optimists:\n↳ You can’t outsource judgment.\n↳ You can’t automate accountability.\n↳ You can’t change what you don’t understand.\n\nExciting times to be in the AI4SE field! 🚀\n\nP.S.

Dusty. Too verbose. Too “enterprisey.”\n\nWrong.\n\nJava quietly powers much of the real world.\nFrom the Spotify app on your phone to backend systems moving trillions of financial transactions, Java is there. Relentless. Invisible. Indispensable.\n\nIt runs Android, Inc. Netflix. LinkedIn. Minecraft. Most banks. Many governments.\nIt’s everywhere.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause Java works!\nIt’s stable. Fast. Secure. Built for scale.\nAnd with every new release, it’s getting better.\n\nJava 23 is proof the language is only accelerating:\n✔️ Streamlined syntax →  A “Hello, World!” now takes just a few lines of code.\n✔️ Pattern matching for primitives → Cleaner logic with less clutter.\n✔️ Markdown for JavaDocs → Documentation that doesn’t make your eyes bleed.\n✔️ Immutable records + sealed classes → Safer data structures, fewer bugs, tighter control.\n\nWhat about AI?\n\nWell, sure, #Python dominates ML/DL/AI.\nBut when it’s time to deployments, many real-world AI systems hum quietly on the JVM.\n\nTake Uber’s Michelangelo platform, it uses Java to serve real-time machine learning predictions at global scale.\n\nAnd with libraries and frameworks like Deeplearning4j, LangChain4J, and TensorFlow integrations, you don’t have to rebuild your systems in Python to get AI features. You just enhance what you already have.\n\nMoreover, I think Java teaches us how to think like an engineer.\nWith strong types and well-established design patterns, Java encourages discipline. It’s simply harder to make a mess.\n\nAnd that discipline? \n\nCould sometimes make a difference 🍵",

        "text": "Today, I attended the dbt Labs meetup at Solita's office in Stockholm. Here’s a key insight I took away:\n\nThe \"semantic layer\" is a big deal for both businesses and developers.\n\nJohan Baltzar shared his journey as a Data Engineer in Spotify’s early days and how a deep understanding of the semantic layer played a crucial role in helping the Swedish 🦄 scale from A to B (as shown in the pictures ⇣).\n\nWhat is the semantic layer? (just in case you wonder)\n\nIt’s a logical abstraction that translates raw data structures (tables, columns, schemas) into user-friendly, meaningful business terms.\n\nFor example, imagine two departments independently calculating revenue. Without a semantic layer, they could report wildly different numbers, both technically correct but confusingly inconsistent. A semantic layer ensures everyone speaks the same language from the start, providing a single, trustworthy definition for terms like \"revenue\".\n\nModern data stacks increasingly rely on semantic layers to democratize data analytics. Looker, Tableau, PowerBI.bg, and dbt Labs all offer semantic-layer capabilities, making it a hot topic in the business world!\n\nThanks to the organizers, I'm looking forward to the next dbt Labs event. 🥂",

        "text": "I don't think we need Scala anymore, the language is doomed and will disappear.\n\nFor context, Scala gained popularity only for these two reasons:\n\n1️⃣ It introduced functional programming features that Java lacked at the time.\n\n2️⃣ The rise of Spark, a big data framework natively written in Scala.\n\nHowever, with Java’s evolution (especially since Java 8, which introduced lambdas and streams) and #Python's dominance in Data Science, Scala is no longer necessary.\n\nThe entire ML/AI ecosystem is built around Python now (NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, etc.). Furthermore, PySpark is good enough for most use cases (even Databricks heavily supports Python for ML workloads).\n\n#Java has caught up, especially with Project Loom and its upcoming features, and any companies that previously used Scala for microservices (e.g., Twitter/X) migrated back to Java or Kotlin.\n\nMoreover, I find Scala cumbersome to learn as a programming language. It's a mix of object-oriented and functional paradigms, and the syntax is not very intuitive (although this might be personal preference).\n\nSo, why does Scala still exist?\n\nFirst, some companies (especially in finance, big data, and ad-tech) have large Scala-based Spark codebases.\n\nSecond, Python APIs (like PySpark) introduce some overhead, as Python needs to communicate with the JVM (via Py4J), which can be a bottleneck in some cases.\n\nFinally, if you enjoy functional programming paradigms (e.g., higher-order functions, pattern matching, and monads), Scala still does them slightly better than Java.\n\nSo, I strongly believe that learning Scala isn't worth it unless your company uses Spark, of course. But if you're mainly doing AI or ML, it's better to focus on Python instead.\n\nFinally, a question for you:\n\nDo you still use Scala, seriously?",

        "text": "I just read the latest blog post by Sean Goedecke. He wrote about what I’ve been thinking about for a while: “The good times in tech are over.”\n\nI mostly agree. The job market in tech didn’t make any sense. We used to live in a Nirvana.\n\nWe all know that. For years, software engineers were untouchable: high salaries, lavish perks, job security, etc.\n\nI personally never felt good about this situation, as I couldn’t understand how it was possible that seasoned school teachers earned less than junior software engineers.\n\nNow we’re seeing more and more layoffs in the tech sector and definitely not the same level of security as before.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause cheap money fueled the tech boom in the 2010s. Companies could afford anything: mass hirings, paying ridiculous salaries, and even maintaining open-source projects. Profitability didn’t matter much when money flowed the way it did.\n\nThen interest rates spiked. Less money from investors, and the game changed.\n\nThe hard truth is thay most tech companies never really cared about open source or sustainability. They were just indulgences for devs in an era of excess.\n\nNow, job security depends on one thing: delivering value that is connected to whatever your company cares about the most.\n\nBut there’s nothing special about this. In fact, this is how businesses operate in the real world. What was actually special was the previous job market situation.\n\nBesides, I think the rise of AI has definitely aggravated this. And for now, it’s merely the expectation of such an impact that causes companies to hire more cautiously.\n\nRegarding AI, here’s what I think we should focus on in order to remain appreciated:\n\n🔹 Move efforts to where actual value is created (the specific business value is often the hardest part to automate with AI).\n\n🔹 Embrace AI, and even better, advocate for it (such a huge and rare opportunity to become an innovator).\n\n🔹 Accept the reality that AI isn’t going anywhere and that the good old times are over (things aren’t going to be as they used to be).\n\nLet’s see how it goes because maybe this is just the beginning of another golden age that we still haven’t understood.\n\nWho knows? 🤷",

        "text": "Lately, I’ve started worrying that I might be losing my ability to write complete apps from scratch.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the more I rely on AI coding assistants, the less I actually code myself.\n\nHere’s how coding used to be:\n\nCreate a file → set up imports and structure → write functions → add logic → something doesn't work → debug → Google the issue → find a fix → write tests → refactor → repeat\n\nHere’s how it works now:\n\nAsk an AI to generate the code → review → tweak logic in natural language → fix minor issues myself, if any → ask AI to fix major ones → repeat\n\nDo you see the difference?\n\nI no longer write the code from scratch anymore, an AI does it for me!\n\nI’ve measured my productivity and there’s no question: I get more done with AI. It allows me to scaffold features in minutes, complete with tests and documentation, things that used to take hours before 🤯\n\nBut here’s my concern…\n\nWhat about the new generation of developers?\n\nFor them, writing code from scratch will feel as outdated as handwriting for everything today. And just like handwriting, the craftsmanship of coding is doomed to fade (not completely, but significantly).\n\nThink about it. A century ago, handwriting was such a crucial skill, people took pride in their calligraphy. Today, \"writing\" no longer means putting words with a pen on paper, now it’s about structuring readable ideas in a digital format.\n\nThe same shift is happening in coding. The act of \"writing code\" will be automated. What will remain is the higher-order skill of thinking systematically in a way that could guide an AI to turn ideas into executable programs that deliver some sort of value.\n\nSo, a few questions before ending this rambling: \n\nShould we still teach coding the hard way (i.e., without AI) like we still teach handwriting in schools? Or will that just feel awkward and outdated? Are we gonna lose the ability to write code from scratch?\n\nI don’t know. Most of us don’t hunt or gather for food anymore, but that doesn't make eating any less satisfying.\n\nIsn’t?",

Instead, we’ll interact with an intelligent agentic UI that knows everything about a company but only presents what we truly want (or are allowed to see).\n\nThink about it. In real life, we don’t communicate with everyone the same way. We adapt our message based on whom we’re speaking to and in which environment we are.\n\nYet today’s websites and apps treat (almost) every customer identically. AI agents are about to end this impersonal online interaction by creating hyper-personalized experiences (i.e., far beyond simple ML recommendation systems).\n\nThe future looks very much agentic, IMHO.\n\nAnd the black boxes will become even darker 🗃️",

        "text": "I’m totally convinced that career growth isn’t about climbing a title ladder.\n\nWe tend to position ourselves within specific categories (e.g., developer, senior engineer, staff engineer, director, CEO, you name it), expecting to jump from one to another eventually.\n\nBut the real game isn’t about titles at all, it’s about conquering complexity.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the amount of value we can create is directly tied to the level of complexity at which we operate.\n\nHere’s a simple heuristic for assessing where you are in our careers and how to reach the next level:\n\n🔹 First, you’re told WHAT to do AND HOW to do it (e.g., junior engineer).\n🔹 Then, you’re just told WHAT to do (e.g., senior engineer).\n🔹 Next, you’re ASKED HOW to do it (e.g., staff engineer).\n🔹 Eventually, you’ll be ASKED WHAT should be done (e.g., director).\n🔹 Finally, no one tells or asks you ANYTHING, you’ll set the goals yourself (e.g., executive level).\n\nDo you see it?\n\nEach step you climb makes you less vulnerable because the amount of value you can deliver increases exponentially. And this happens because your capacity to handle more complexity increases. Low complexity → staying at the bottom → higher risk of being replaced.\n\nSo, our real career growth is actually shaped by the challenges we must conquer to climb the complexity ladder.\n\nFor example, here’s a roadmap for developers:\n\n1️⃣ First, we must master the art of managing complexity in code. We should learn algorithms, exploratory data analysis (EDA), software architecture, and so.\n\n2️⃣ Second, knowing how to code isn’t enough. We must identify which problems are worth solving. The complexity here lies in navigating uncertainty and delivering real-world value.\n\n3️⃣ Third, we must make sense of chaos. Leaders at the highest levels don’t just solve problems, they choose which problems matter. They craft narratives, shape strategies, and define purpose.\n\nSo, let’s stop obsessing over titles. Instead, let’s ask ourselves: \"Which layer am I in, and what level of complexity am I ready to conquer next?”\n\nThat’s how real growth happens 🪜\n\nP.S.

This creates an environment where tailored AI agents can interact, take action, and deliver value without human intervention.\n\nI believe this technology has the potential to accelerate processes with incredible efficiency.\n\nFor example, I just watched a demo of the coming Google Agentspace. The deployment of agents there allowed the creation of a live onboarding guide for new hires... in seconds! The key innovation is that it continuously updates with information that is specific to the given employee role.\n\nHere are some of the most interesting features of agentic ecosystems:\n\n🔹 Task sharing: AI agents can pass tasks to each other to complete more complex activities.\n\n🔹 Guardrails: We can impose restrictions on the agents to regulate their actions (to some extent).\n\n🔹 Action logs: We’ll have detailed logs (a.k.a. traces) showing exactly what AI agents are doing at each step.\n\nJust as cloud services revolutionized IT infrastructure a few years ago, agentic ecosystems scale very well and can be applied to practically any use case involving automation. The competition will be fierce in this space. Ouch. \n\nIn the meantime, I can only hope this will help cut down bureaucracy and paperwork across industries.\n\nWe’ll see 🍿\n\nP.S.

        "text": "I just finished reading a recent paper that explores the potential of applying agentic workflows to financial services.\n\nIt’s very clear (to me) that traditional methods for handling financial assets will fall behind quite soon, given the huge advantages of AI-powered systems.\n\nThe current LLMs-based technology allows building specialized agents for almost every financial task. From feature engineering to model evaluation, these systems deliver the precision and resilience that traditional methods simply cannot.\n\nConcretely, the paper focuses on two use cases for agentic AI systems:\n\n1️⃣ FINANCIAL MODELING: The agentic crew consists of a manager and multiple agents who perform specific tasks such as exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, model training, model evaluation, and writing documentation.\n\n2️⃣ MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT: The agentic  crew consists of a manager along with specialized agents who perform tasks such as checking compliance of modeling documentation, model replication, conceptual soundness, analysis of outcomes, and writing documentation.\n\nThe results show that AI agents can effectively collaborate to perform these complex tasks in real-time.\n\nThe agents were able to streamline the modeling workflow, carry out model risk management procedures on a trained model, and effectively manage dependencies as well as collaboration among other agents.\n\nThe novelty of these models is that they learn, adapt, and evolve by themselves. For example, they can detect fraud with unprecedented accuracy, approve credit with confidence, and manage portfolio risk with unmatched efficiency.\n\nEventually, there will be adaptive learning agents that continuously improve their performance through past interactions and the various feedback they receive. Another even more interesting improvement will be agents capable of developing their own agents, tools, and tasks required for specific operations.\n\nAre we about to reach the next frontier in financial modeling?\n\nOr have we already surpassed it?\n\nHere’s the paper: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dCH_jSjg",

Our focus now is on rapid model adaptation through data and prompting.\n\n2️⃣ AI models produce open-ended outputs, which significantly complicates evaluation.\n\nBut success has measurable value. If our evaluation methods aren’t robust, our projects will fail.\n\n3️⃣ Foundation models are massive, resource-intensive, and slow.\n\nThis isn’t just inconvenient, it creates an urgent demand for engineers skilled in GPU management, efficient model training, and optimization. Without these skills, the most ambitious AI projects risk never reaching production.\n\nSo, to succeed today as a Data Scientist, mastering the following skills isn’t optional:\n\n→ Prompt engineering: Powerful, nuanced, and surprisingly impactful.\n\n→ Data engineering for production: Essential for scaling, managing resources effectively, and ensuring our AI solutions are robust and deployable.\n\n→ Fine-tuning smaller models: Complex, requiring more data and expertise, but offering dramatic improvements in performance, latency, and cost.\n\nLast but not least, working with frameworks like Hugging Face and LangChain, and learning Data Engineering skills for production-ready deployment is super relevant.\n\nI’m deeply into this. Are you? 😉",

        "text": "What's the actual difference between invention and innovation?\n\nInvention → It’s about creating something novel, perhaps ingenious, yet it doesn’t imply anyone actually needs or wants it.\n\nInnovation → It occurs when an invention addresses real-world problems (e.g., when customers find that a product is actually usable).\n\nCustomer-centricity, therefore, acts as the catalyst, transforming abstract inventions into impactful innovations.\n\nIn the #AI field, I think we often celebrate inventions: new models with groundbreaking performance, papers that set benchmarks, or novel frameworks that speed up prototyping. Yet, true innovation occurs only when these powerful ideas and tools meet genuine user needs (i.e., when AI becomes customer-centric).\n\nFor example, the invention of #LLMs was impressive, but it became innovative only when products like ChatGPT made them accessible, intuitive, and impactful for millions of everyday users.\n\nOn the other hand, sometimes inventions are ahead of their time precisely because they're too customer-centric. They assume customer needs that don't yet exist or aren't yet understood (e.g., Microsoft’s Clippy).\n\nToday, I believe many AI startups fail because they're too \"ahead of their users,\" disconnected from real-world needs. They're brilliant, but not relatable.\n\nIt’s the deliberate act of understanding and anticipating customer desires (and frustrations) the thing that transforms impressive AI inventions into powerful innovations.\n\nCorollary → Invention alone isn't enough.\n\nIt is the act of understanding users that actually turns inventions into impactful innovations. \n\nSo let’s keep creating new things with curiosity, but innovate with empathy and common sense. \n\nWishing you a great weekend! 😉",

Newcomers like Langfuse, Gorilla, and Chainlit are rapidly reshaping the market. Even Dify, a newer player, has surged dramatically.\n\nBut here's the shocking part:\n\nWhen looking at where contributions come from (measured by the number of pull-requests), the #US and #China completely dominate the landscape. Europe is almost invisible.\n\nWhy aren’t we seeing more European open-source projects shaping the future of LLMs? Is it a lack of awareness? Funding? Community support?\n\nOne thing is clear: if Europe doesn't actively engage now, it risks being left behind… sidelined in one of the most crucial technological revolutions of our lifetime!\n\nLet’s change that. If you're into AI, start contributing to some EU project with a healthy community. If you're in tech, spread the word. \n\nThe future of AI shouldn’t be built by just two countries 🕊️",

The passion for pushing the boundaries of #GenAI in game development was truly inspiring.\n\nBig thanks to Mattias Karlsson, Jeanne Göthberg, and ☀️ Rakiv Joy for organizing such a great event!\n\nAlready looking forward to the next session in April! 🎮",

If you want to track the hottest open-source projects or uncover hidden gems, this is the place to look.\n\nMy favorite feature is the Collections tab. It categorizes repositories by domain (AI, LLMs, crypto, finance, and more) while also tracking their historical ranking by relevant metrics with cool visualizations.\n\nFor example, the video below shows the popularity of repositories in the AI category from February 2011 to March 2025, based on the number of GitHub stars. We can see that scikit-learn was a big player for almost 5 years (these were the golden days of traditional ML), then the arrival of Deep Learning took the lead with TensorFlow and reigned for many years, until recently PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers started closing the gap.\n\nOSS Insight also has a data explorer feature that allows you to query the data in natural language.

I expected the interview to start at 15:00, and at 15:15, I asked the receptionist if I could somehow contact him.\n\nSo she called the interviewer. While waiting, I checked my phone, and my heart sank.\n\nThe interview was supposed to start at 14:00. For some reason, I thought it was at 15:00. Bang!\n\nI was 1 hour late.\n\nAt that moment, I felt like a complete failure, but I was already there, and running away from trouble is not my thing.\n\nThe interviewer arrived at 15:30.\n\nWe shook hands, and he led me into a meeting room.\n\nI didn’t make excuses. I didn’t try to justify it. I just apologized (a lot).\n\nHe simply said once: \"Let's leave it behind.\"\n\nThat was it.\n\nFor the next 2 hours, I had one of the most engaging technical discussions of my life.\n\nLooking back, I wonder: How often do we hold onto someone else’s mistake instead of letting it go?\n\nHow many times have I let frustration cloud my judgment when someone disappointed me?\n\nThat day, I learned something more valuable than any job offer: The ability to forgive and move on is a rare strength.\n\nI didn’t get the job in the end, but I walked away with a far greater and more valuable experience.\n\nLeave the past behind. Give people grace. You never know what impact it might have.\n\nCheers! 🥂",

        "text": "Why is it impossible to compress all human knowledge into an AI model?\n\nI could hardly imagine a world where every published book, every scientific discovery ever made, and every human thought is compressed into a single AI that knows EVERYTHING.\n\nNevertheless, it sounds like the ultimate achievement, right? \n\nBut this type of data compression has fundamental limits, dictated by Kolmogorov complexity, Shannon’s information theory, and the nature of knowledge.\n\nLet's have a deeper look at these three limitations:\n\n1️⃣ The shortest possible description of any dataset is its Kolmogorov complexity. It represents the length of the smallest algorithm that can generate it. It is uncomputable in the general case, meaning no algorithm can determine the absolute shortest representation of arbitrary data.\n\nFurthermore, some sequences have no algorithmically shorter description than themselves, they are incompressible. While much of human knowledge follows structured patterns, large portions contain chaotic unpredictability, making a truly lossless compression of everything fundamentally impossible.\n\n2️⃣ Shannon’s information theory defines entropy as the minimum number of bits needed to optimally encode a message. High-entropy data has less redundancy and cannot be compressed beyond a fundamental limit.\n\nThe problem is that not all human knowledge is low-entropy. While structured facts can be compressed efficiently, much of what we call \"knowledge\" includes uncertainty, noise, ambiguity, and subjective interpretation. Some knowledge is inherently probabilistic, meaning it lacks a fully deterministic structure that allows for compression.\n\n3️⃣ Even if we could encode all knowledge at one moment, it would immediately become outdated. Knowledge is non-stationary, i.e., it is not a fixed dataset but an evolving process.\n\nNew discoveries invalidate old assumptions, cultural contexts shift, and scientific revolutions rewrite fundamental truths. A model that captures \"everything\" today will still fail to encapsulate what comes next.\n\nSo what?\n\nAI models, no matter how advanced, function as approximate compression algorithms: identifying patterns, reducing complexity, and reconstructing knowledge efficiently. \n\nBut as just discussed, compression is never perfect.\n\nSomething is always lost. And what’s lost might be the very essence of intelligence itself: intuition, serendipity, and the unforeseen connections that drive human creativity.\n\nSo, would it ever be possible to build a super-intelligent AI that encapsulates everything?\n\nNo.\n\nAnd even though the latest AI models seem to be very competent (think of ChatGPT 4.5 and o1),... folks, let’s not forget the fundamental limits of what is truly possible 🧠",

        "text": "I've always been fascinated by how months of computation and vast amounts of knowledge can be distilled into a single array of bytes that fits in memory.\n\nIn ML, a ton of data massaging work, terabytes of information, and countless hours of computation can fit into a single file (a.k.a. the trained model ready for deployment).\n\nAs a data scientist, my job often comes down to delivering this model file to be seamlessly integrated into an MLOps pipeline. Once delivered, the file could be loaded to perform inference on real-time and real-world data.\n\nWhat’s inside?\n\nThat file encodes what the model have  learned. The weights and biases that determine how it makes predictions. Combined with its architecture (in the case of neural networks) or parameters (for statistical models), this forms the brain of an AI system.\n\nBut this brain is actually patterns extracted from massive datasets, fine-tuned neural network weights, decision tree splits, and distilled knowledge from everything the model has learned. And yet, all of this is stored in a file formatted as .pth (PyTorch), .ckpt (TensorFlow), .h5 (Keras), or the novel .safetensors (Hugging Face).\n\nTake these examples:\n\n• An XGBoost model trained on millions of data points, with a limited number of trees and controlled depth, can fit into a few megabytes and make predictions in milliseconds.\n\n• A computer vision model, trained on millions of images, can be optimized and quantized to run efficiently on a smartphone.\n\n• A LLM like GPT-4, trained on trillions of words and distilled into a highly optimized terabytes model, can predict the next token with sub-second latency on high-performance hardware.\n\nEvery model file represents months of human effort: cleaning data, optimizing pipelines, running experiments, and fine-tuning parameters until it’s ready for deployment.\n\nNow my question is: \n\nIs it possible to digitally compress everything, inc. all the human knowledge?\n\nThe answer is (fortunately?) negative, and it's due to fundamental limits imposed by information theory, Kolmogorov complexity, and the nature of data entropy.\n\nBut that’s a topic for tomorrow's post 😉",

But this approach will never lead us to true human-like intelligence. No matter how much computational power or data we throw at it, there’s a fundamental limitation because it’s a computational search problem at its core. \n\nWe need something else.\n\nToday, I stumbled upon SICS.AI, a Swedish company with the mission of rethinking AI from the bottom up. The idea is to advance #AGI development by focusing on how an intelligent organism navigates its world through learning, planning, and reasoning.\n\nSICS.AI is based in Stockholm, a thriving global hub for innovation, with access to top-tier research networks like AI Sweden, SWIRA: Swedish Industrial Robot Association, and Vinnova. With a team of scientists from KTH Royal Institute of Technology and pioneers like the founders of Oracle MySQL and JRockit, they are making another push to lead the charge toward AGI 🚀\n\nPersonally, I think the next big challenge is building an AI model that doesn’t just analyze data but actually “understands” it as a human would. And the idea of using robots to create a \"world map,\" much like a child who, though new to the world, learns through experience and exploration, is exciting to me 🙂\n\nNo doubt that AI will soon transform industries and revolutionize automation through next-gen embodied intelligence, and I’m very glad to see Sweden being part of the leap! 🇸🇪\n\nP.S.

        "text": "The openness of LLM training data is already being exploited to inject harmful information into AI systems.\n\nThis practice is called “model poisoning,” and it’s a growing threat ⚠️\n\nToday’s models could be easily compromised with false or misleading data, forever distorting the outputs they generate.\n\nFor example:\n\nWhat do you think would happens if malicious actors flood popular forums with misleading political statements or fake news during election campaigns? Current LLMs \"learn\" from these false narratives and, in turn, generate biased or factually incorrect information that is hard to revert, perpetuating a misinformation cycle ♻️\n\nHere's how to prevent model poisoning:\n\n✓ Curate and filter training data meticulously.\n✓ Use anomaly detection to spot strange patterns.\n✓ Apply techniques like differential privacy and adversarial training to strengthen models.\n✓ Regularly audit and monitor models to detect any signs of poisoning.\n✓ Limit data source access, rely on trusted datasets, and consider synthetic data.\n✓ Collaborate with experts, share knowledge, and retrain models periodically to stay ahead.\n\nThe above techniques are a good start; however, as AI-generated content floods the internet, future models will inevitably be trained on it. Indeed, research shows that we’re already running out of public high quality training data 🤯 \n\nThis could create an endless loop of AI generated data also used for training that’s harder to control.\n\nAnother big problem is data retention. If an already deleted piece of information was part of an LLM's training data, the model might still generate and share it, potentially exposing removed material. Meaning everything you put online will be \"remembered\" by an AI model, whether you want it or not.\n\nSo, the question is:\n\nHow do we ensure models are trained from trustful data sources and forget harmful information they’ve learned?\n\nThese are an open research questions that I find very interesting, and it’s not just about preventing “model poisoning.” It’s about preserving the integrity of the entire AI ecosystem.\n\nWe need to solve these kind of issues before the whole system completely swallows itself ⏳",

This simple formula (derived from the logarithmic formula for compound interest) lets you estimate how long it’ll take for an investment to reach 2x its value, based on a fixed annual return.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nYears to Double = 72 / rate of return (r)\n\nThat’s it. Just one number to keep in mind.\n\nFor example, if your investment grows at 8% per year, it will take:\n\n72 / 8 = 9 years to reach 2x its value\n\nHere's why I use the Rule of 72:\n\n→ Quick mental math to estimate returns for interest rates between 6% and 10%.\n→ Works for inflation, population growth, and investment returns.\n→ Simple but powerful trick for quick financial decisions.\n\n🌟 Pro tip: For rates under 6%, use 69 instead of 72 for more accuracy. For rates over 10%, use 75 to get closer to the truth.",

        "text": "How are the hyperparameters of LLMs fine-tuned without blowing up already massive budgets? 💰\n\nAs we know, when training \"small\" ML models, we can afford to test different hyperparameters repeatedly, tweaking them until we get the best results. But with LLMs? There’s usually only one shot at training.\n\nSo, I just went deep into different hyperparameter tuning techniques for LLMs and discovered the concept of \"scaling extrapolation.\"\n\nIn essence, it’s the process of predicting which hyperparameters will work best on large models based on testing smaller ones. Scaling extrapolation is crucial because training large models is a massive resource drain, and we just can’t afford to mess around with endless combinations.\n\nWhy does it works?\n\nEmpirical research has shown that many optimal hyperparameters remain stable when model size changes. For example, a 2022 paper from researchers at Microsoft and OpenAI demonstrated that it is possible to transfer hyperparameters from a 40M model to a 6.7B model: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY3Ef6Vk\n\nInterestingly, scaling extrapolation is still a niche field, tackled by only a few experts.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it’s incredibly complex. If we have just 10 hyperparameters, we’re already looking at over 1,000 combinations to test. The complexity explodes as more hyperparameters interact with each other.\n\nI find this challenge fascinating.\n\nFor now, it’s very unlikely that will be working on training large models at this scale. However, what seemed large two years ago is considered small today. Staying ahead means knowing about techniques (like scaling extrapolation) before they become essential. This is how we break through.\n\nWant to dive deeper into scaling extrapolation? Check out this insightful blog post: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dhMctqYc by luke metz.\n\nThere’s no doubt: hyperparameter tuning has already reached the next level 🚀",

It includes everything from $50 bug fixes to $32,000 full-stack feature builds, covering web, mobile, APIs, and cross-codebase interactions.\n\nThe initial benchmark results? \n\nWell... the paper claims that AI still falls short, but I believe the results are already quite impressive.\n\nThe best model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, managed to earn $208,050 out of a possible $500,800 in the SWE-Lancer Diamond subset. On the full dataset, it scraped together $400,000 out of $1 million. Of course, still not quite there yet to fully replacing human engineers, but already BIG if we consider it’s just the beginning.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nAI-assisted software development will reshape the job market (without any doubt) especially for freelancers and junior engineers (as stated in the “Impact Statement” section 7 in the paper). However, we're still far from having fully autonomous AI engineers. More importantly, AI-generated code also comes with serious risks. For example, security vulnerabilities, bad architecture, and potential model autonomy concerns.\n\nNevertheless, the road to fully autonomous AI-driven software engineering could be shorter than we think! 🤖\n\nLet’s go to the 🏖️\n\n🔗 The paper: https://lnkd.in/dg7egWXZ\n🔗 The benchmark: https://lnkd.in/dtYHjtes",

        "text": "Foundational models have radically changed the way we build and ship AI apps these days.\n\nIn traditional ML, we start by gathering DATA, move on to training and evaluating a MODEL, and only then (and depending on the results) is that we focus on enhancing the PRODUCT. This approach has its merits, e.g., we can fine-tune the model to meet our specific needs and ensure that the data is good enough before launching. However, with pre-trained models already available, this process is painfully slow and inefficient. Why? Because we could spend weeks or months gathering the right data and fine-tuning our model(s)... while the product remains in a constant flux.\n\nThankfully, we don’t need to follow that path anymore.\n\nWhen building on top of foundational models, instead of getting stuck in endless data wrangling, we can start by building the product with AI-generated data and see if it works for a pilot number of users. Once we’ve got something promising, we can do real data and model optimizations. \n\nI find this shift a game-changer!\n\nIt isn’t about creating better user interfaces powered by AI, it’s about getting the product to market faster. And that means we can start understanding real user needs much earlier, adapt quickly, and iterate faster.\n\nFor example, imagine you’re developing a new app aimed at helping small businesses manage their finances. Before, you would have spent months analyzing customer data, cleaning it, and fine-tuning a model. But then, after a while, you find out the users didn’t actually want to reduce expenses, what they wanted was to better understand customers to maximize ROI instead. By leading with the product first, we could have launched an early version, gathered ROI feedback, and launched accordingly without waiting for Model v1.0 to be ready.\n\nSo, getting to market faster is a huge advantage. The quicker we get the feedback, the quicker we can adjust, and the better we can refine our offering to match what users ACTUALLY want, not just what we think they want 😉\n\nWe don’t need perfect data, we need quicker insights. We can build, test, and adjust along the way.\n\nJust start building, and let it go 🚀",

        "text": "Big tech companies are once again pushing employees back to the office with the argument of \"increased productivity.\" \n\nIt’s a quiet and effective way to cut staff without mass layoffs.\n\nNow, some companies are going further, proposing pay cuts for remote workers. Wait, what? They claim that remote work is a \"benefit\" and should come at a cost. \n\nI think this doesn't make any sense:\n\n❶ Companies save on office space, utilities, and logistics when employees work remotely. In fact, keeping employees on-site is far less cost-efficient.\n\n❷ If a company bans remote work, probably one of the following is true:\n\n→ It lacks the infrastructure to support it.\n→ It doesn't trust its employees.\n\nNeither is a good sign.\n\n❸ Personally, my best creative moments come when I change my environment. Sitting in the same office all day drains my energy (even more so than working fully remotely). \n\nThe best balance is hybrid: structured for collaboration and flexible enough for deep focus.\n\nTo my surprise, some studies suggest that many tech workers would be willing to take a 25% salary cut for the privilege of remote work 🤯\n\nThe real question isn’t if tech companies should allow remote work or not; it’s how it's possible for them (and us) to even consider going back to full-time on-site workstations.",

        "text": "The traditional computer science education system MUST change radically as AI becomes truly ubiquitous.\n\nIn the past... do you remember? It was all about having the right knowledge and  \"programmer's mindset.\" We started by learning pseudocode, picking a language, and reading books that began with a bunch of syntax before diving deep into classical algorithms and data structures. Solving problems from scratch has been the pillar of traditional computer science education for a long time!\n\nBut today, all of this seems irrelevant to me. Why?\n\nBecause nearly every small coding problem I can think of has already been solved, and the unsolved ones are too big for me to solve alone. Furthermore, AI-powered coding assistants can generate high-quality code faster than I ever could. With a simple prompt, they can build entire applications, optimize algorithms, and refactor complex codebases.\n\nSo, do we still need to know the nitty-gritty details of syntax and classical algorithms?\n\nProbably not.\n\n→ Manually implementing a sorting algorithm? ❌ \n\n→ Understanding the nuances of pointer arithmetic in C? ❌ \n\n→ Memorizing syntax rules for multiple programming languages? ❌ \n\nSo, what do we need instead?\n\n→ The ability to ask the right QUESTIONS and EVALUATE AI-generated responses ✅\n\nThese are the new technical skills that will define the future of learning (in almost every other field, I believe).\n\nOur education system needs to shift accordingly. Instead of emphasizing rote memorization, we must cultivate a mindset of questioning EVERYTHING and rigorously verifying AI-generated answers.\n\nThe result of this upcoming educational transformation is uncertain.\n\nBut…\n\nI don’t see any other way forward 🤔\n\nP.S.

        "text": "Game Development and AI Engineering have so much to learn from each other.\n\nThis was my take after attending Alexander Chatzizacharias’ talk at Jfokus this year titled “What is Multimodal RAG, and Can You Build a Village with It?” It was a perfect mix of education and seemingly (absurd?) fun, inspiring anyone to explore the potential of multimodal RAG in the gaming industry.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) is the technique of combining your own textual, visual, and audio data to enrich prompts before they’re processed by GenAI. Imagine a user asks a question, and the system digs into a personalized data pool for context, and then through GenAI it delivers a coherent, relevant response.\n\nWe can use multimodal RAG in video games, and I’m particularly excited about MRAG’s potential to create games that are both more engaging and intellectually stimulating.\n\nTraditionally, Non-Player Characters (NPCs) rely on static, hardcoded responses. But with MRAG, we can make them dynamic, lifelike, and far more engaging to interact with. For example, we can build NPCs that not only respond intelligently but also interact with each other, pursue goals, and move dynamically within the game world (all powered by complex RAG workflows).\n\nThis is exactly what Alexander explored in his session, and it’s a game-changer. He showed how much more fun it could be for gamers to interact with NPCs that are smart enough to search for and display multimedia assets. \n\nTwo examples: 1️⃣ an NPC finding and playing a metal song that matches the player’s mood in a specific game scenario, or 2️⃣ interpreting the player’s own paintings in real-time.\n\nCool, huh?",

In the future, the winners will be those who embrace applications' simplicity, scale, and ethics, while staying grounded in real-world needs.”\n\n→ But the AI landscape moves insanely fast, and we’re either pushing the boundaries or getting left behind.\n\n“To make AI a lasting success, focus on creating products that truly solve problems for the customer, rather than just jumping on the bandwagon. Who knows? Maybe your next AI project will end up as the one everyone’s talking about. Or maybe it will be yet another 'failed startup' story. You will never know until you try.”\n\n→ Again, success isn’t about jumping on the latest trend, it’s about solving real-world problems that matter to people.\n\nThe question for me now is:\n\nAm I focusing enough on what truly matters, or am I getting too caught up in the hype?\n\nIDK.",

        "text": "My research work has just reached 700 citations on Google Scholar, and I would like to reflect on it.\n\n7x100 might sound like a small number for seasoned researchers, but for me, it’s a milestone. Why? Because it feels incredible to see that my work has made at least a tiny impact, being referenced by researchers worldwide.\n\nDo citations matter?\n\nWell, yes… but maybe not in the way you’d think.\n\nCitations are often seen as a benchmark for research impact, but they don't tell the full story. They reflect how often a research paper is used as a foundation for further studies, but they don’t necessarily measure the quality or depth of contributions. Some of the papers I’m most proud of have taken years to gain traction (e.g., my DepClean paper currently ranked 1st in my profile took 3 years to get traction), while other papers have got cited quickly due to trending topics or collaborative networks (e.g., my Data Mining in sports paper, ranked 2nd in my profile took me by surprise).\n\nWhat have I learned about citations?\n\n→ High-quality work, even if initially overlooked, will eventually get cited. The prestige of the journal or conference definitely plays a role, but solid research speaks for itself over time.\n\n→ Co-authoring with researchers from different institutions or disciplines increases exposure, leading to more citations.\n\n→ Even highly specialized research can gain significant attention if it addresses a critical gap or introduces a novel perspective.\n\nFor most researchers, the number of citations per year tends to grow linearly but eventually plateaus.

        "text": "Documenting source code is a waste of time and space nowadays 🗑️\n\nI still remember the days when we were arguing about different documentation practices and paradigms. Then, tools like Doxygen, Javadoc, and Sphinx were created to FORCE us (lazy developers) to explain our code in an organized way using \"templates.\" They extracted API signatures, methods, parameters, and more, transforming them into human-readable form, often in HTML or Markdown formats, so that our colleagues and future versions of ourselves could easily understand what the code was supposed to do.\n\nBut our battle tested doc tools are not very useful anymore.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause current AI can generate good enough documentation automatically for us. For example, GitHub Copilot's chat can answer the “what it does” and the “how it does it” questions for any function (in milliseconds and with very high accuracy) 🤯\n\nSo, code documentation has fallen into automation, becoming a commodity.\n\nIndeed, I believe that most code documentation today is actually noise.\n\nThink about it. Today, IDEs help us create meaningful variable names easily. They generate all kinds of templates. Typing is not what slows us down anymore: READING IS! The more code we have to read, the longer it takes to understand what needs to be changed in the codebase. So documentation becomes a waste of time in the eyes of efficient developers.\n\nSo, should all comments disappear?\n\nThe only scenario in which writing a comment makes sense to me is when we use it to add information about the “why this way.” For example, adding a comment when checking for the existence of a specific configuration file in a function to ensure that custom settings load correctly for various deployment environments. This kind of info adds more “context” about why the code does what a prompted AI said it does (i.e., it reflects the human decision made along the way).\n\nIn essence, future documentation requires a narrative. Without it, you just wind up splatting unnecessary words on a codebase, rather than communicating anything useful to the other devs or their AI partners.\n\nAnd yes, I’m sorry for the billions of lines of open-source comments and the many human hours invested in them (nothing wrong because they have helped build the AI models after all).\n\nR.I.P. my dear Javadoc 🪦",

But that’s not a bad thing. It means we’ll be FORCED to keep learning, adapting, and growing.\n\nSo, the big question is: which jobs will survive the AI wave?\n\nNo one knows for sure 🤷‍♂️ \n\nBut there are already some existing tech roles that are at high risk of replacement:\n\n❌ Rutinary dev tasks → AI-powered tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT can now write boilerplate code, reducing the need for entry level devs who traditionally started their careers handling common and often repetitive coding tasks.\n\n❌ Low-level data analysis → Many BI dashboards and AI assistants can now interpret trends, generate statistical reports, and more. These tools will sooner or later replace some junior data analyst roles.\n\n❌ Manual software testing → Automated testing frameworks and AI-powered test generation are already replacing traditional QA roles focused on manual testing.\n\nThese are just 3 examples. Arguably, ALL coding jobs could be automated to some extent, posing a real risk to disrupt the dev job market.\n\nOne thing is certain: CHANGE is the only constant. If we keep doing the same thing for too long without evolving, our skills will eventually become obsolete.\n\nThe ONLY option is to move up the value chain, focusing on high-level problem-solving, creativity, and improving our collaboration with AI.\n\nSo let’s keep learning. Keep sharing. Keep changing.\n\nBecause standing still will only lead us to fall behind ⏳",

I also learned about the latest and greatest tools and features from well-established Swedish companies such as Neo4j, Scania Group, and Akka.\n\nAnd of course, SEB was present once again 🚀.

        "text": "Data is the new oil, and it is being sucked up indiscriminately, without any respect for laws or boundaries 🛢️\n\nOpenAI, Claude, Anthropic, and others have scraped my personal website, my code on GitHub, and all the things I've shared online. They have used MY work to train THEIR models. Now, they’re claiming this as their data and #profiting from it.\n\nFor example, below is the response from ChatGPT when asked about \"The Last Paper’s Myth,\" something I wrote about last year. The answer reflects many of the ideas I shared back then, and I suspect it’s (partially) the data they used for training. But there is no link to my post anywhere in the response 🤷‍♂️\n\nJust to be clear, I’m VERY happy to share everything I know online, but I don’t like the idea of others making money from it without providing any sort of #attribution.\n\nIt’s bad, and I’m concerned about a few things that could go wrong if this continues:\n\n• It could lead to more content being locked behind paywalls, especially scientific literature (leading to more Elseviers, Springers, etc.). We’re already seeing this trend!\n\n• Writers might become discouraged from producing long-form content because it’s not gratifying to spend hours writing just for the sake of feeding an AI that will plagiarize* and sell their ideas (people like writing for other people, not machines).\n\n• We could fall into a dangerous cycle of (mis)information convergence, where we simply trust whatever an AI \"understands\" about a topic. This is very risky for ideological freedom and literacy.\n\nOver the years, we’ve built a system where free, open science coexists together with closed journals and patents. It’s far from perfect, but at least authorship and attribution are #respected.\n\nThe current AI race, however, doesn’t operate like that at all!\n\nSo here I am, once again, tying to rise awareness, and hoping to see truly free, open-code, open-data, and open-weights models to be the ones going first at the end of this AI race.\n\nTime will tell… ⌛\n\n*plagiarize → : to steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own : use (another's production) without crediting the source (The Merriam-Webster Dictionary).",

        "text": "*Multitasking* doesn’t work, we all know that. But really?\n\nWe live in a world where juggling many tasks is hard to avoid. We deal with a bombardment of real-time messaging threads, emails popping up, and online meetings, often all at once. What is worst, this kind of #multitasking is sometimes perceived as a sign of efficiency 🤯\n\nIn this era of perpetual distraction, understanding the limits of our multitasking capabilities is crucial for optimizing work #performance. \n\nSo, I looked into this topic and stumbled upon an interesting paper from 2011 that showed empirical evidence that multitasking can improve productivity, but only up to a certain point: 🔗https://lnkd.in/gAvHFfXN\n\nThe paper’s findings are pretty clear: medium multitaskers perform reasonably well when it comes to handling many computer-based multitasking tasks, while high multitaskers suffer from it. However, accuracy declines steadily with increased multitasking, no matter how much you juggle! 🙄\n\n“…juggling multiple tasks is much more difficult while balancing on a high wire, where performance mishaps can have serious consequences.”\n\nThe results follow a classic inverted-U curve for productivity: multitasking helps until it doesn't. At first, switching between tasks boosts your mental alertness and efficiency. But after a certain point, switching too often leads to mental #overload, making it harder to maintain focus and accuracy on mid complexity tasks.\n\nSo, what does this mean for us in 2025? 🤷‍♂️\n\nOver the last decade, we’ve exponentially increased the number of information channels we juggle at work. It’s likely that many of us have BECOME high multitaskers in the process, without even noticing it.\n\nTo maintain both speed and accuracy, we should focus on fewer tasks at a time (ideally in sequence, without overlap). And if you ever feel overloaded, take a step back, evaluate your multitasking habits, and aim for that sweet spot where productivity is achieved without compromising #quality.\n\nSeriously, too much multitasking can seriously compromise the quality of our work.\n\nIt’s all about balance and awareness 😉\n\n*A common form of multitasking occurs when a user shifts attention to perform several independent but concurrent computer-based tasks.",

        "text": "It’s not about the latest models, expensive GPUs, or overpriced consultants. I think DATA is the only thing that truly matters!!!\n\nI still remember the times when we had multiple Machine Learning algorithms that operated under distinct paradigms (e.g., KNN → lazy learning, Bayesian → statistical, Random Forest → decision trees). Then, everything shifted toward Deep Learning thanks to the availability of powerful hardware. More recently, it all seems to be about leveraging the greatest minds with the best ideas to put them all #together.\n\nBut I argue that one thing has remained unchanged: the need to process massive amounts of messy #data, and that this is the everlasting skill 🪄\n\nJust as an example, the creators of DeepSeek shared their model architecture and its trained weights with the world as open-source. But what’s the one thing they kept completely secret? Their training data 🤔\n\nSo, if I could only master ONE skill, it wouldn’t be tweaking models or fine-tuning hyperparameters. It would be handling data at #scale, i.e., building efficient pipelines, automating workflows, and ensuring data quality. This is a top 1% skill that will remain valuable for decades.\n\nAt a high level, there are three fundamental steps:\n\n1️⃣ Extracting data from its source\n2️⃣ Transforming and cleaning that data\n3️⃣ Delivering the cleaned data optimally to the right destination \n\n* This process is commonly known as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load).\n\nAnd sure, building a simple ETL pipeline for an AI system isn’t hard (most developers can build chatbots easily these days). But the real challenge lies in designing resilient, scalable, and fault-tolerant data systems that can handle ever-growing #complexity.\n\nAnd that’s why our dear data engineers aren’t going anywhere in the years to come 😉",

        "text": "Have you actually noticed the significant improvements in AI recently? 📈\n\nI have, but not that much (as a single user).\n\nQuick recap: last month, OpenAI’s o3 model surpassed human domain experts by a wide margin on many high-level #benchmarks, the same for the Chinese DeepSeek this month. However, I haven’t felt the impact personally. Why? Because these advancements now focus on narrowing AI’s expertise into specific knowledge areas.\n\nIndeed, researchers are now working to automate AI research itself, which could theoretically trigger a rapid increase of scientific #discoveries across specific domains (inc. foundational science).\n\nLet’s take #software development as an example. To better evaluate AI’s coding abilities, researchers developed SWE-Bench (a benchmark that tests how well AI can solve actual open issues in popular OSS). Just one year ago, the top verified score was 4.4%, but today, OpenAI’s o3 model achieves an astonishing 72%. This leap is a milestone toward automating the software craft.\n\nBut at the same time, the gap between AI’s public face and its true capabilities is widening. \n\nProgress is now measured at the level of AI models with PhD-level expertise in niche areas of knowledge.\n\nThis makes it harder for the public and policymakers to grasp AI’s real progress, much less regulate it effectively.\n\nThe risk isn’t that AI development has stalled. The real danger is that we’re losing our ability to track where it’s headed.\n\nDon’t you think? 🤔",

He mentioned how this automatically puts him at a disadvantage.\n\nI asked him about his current #approach, and his response went something like this (summarized):\n\n“Dear M, my name is X, and I have skills in Y and Z, as demonstrated by the successful projects A and B that I’ve completed. I’m interested in working with you on P, where I can leverage A and B to achieve D. I’ve already applied to the open position you have for P. Regards, X.”\n\nI suggested he try changing his approach to something like this (summarized):\n\n“Hi M, I recently came across the article A written by C (the CEO of your company), and her vision V deeply resonates with me because of A and B. I also noticed your LinkedIn post L, and it’s inspiring to me how you’re driving progress toward that vision. By the way, my name is X, and I believe we share some common synergies that could lead to meaningful collaboration. I’d love to learn more about your business and share my ideas regarding P. Cheers, X.”\n\nDo you see the difference?\n\nThe second version demonstrates genuine interest and enthusiasm for the company’s #goals. It shows that you #understand those goals, provide relevant context, and create a sense of synergy. Finally, it proposes sharing new ideas for free, sparking #curiosity.\n\nI believe that smart people are always on the lookout for other smart people who align with their goals and can identify new OPPORTUNITIES.\n\nDo you agree? 😃",

In factories, there were production lines, and manual workers were hands-on, performing repetitive tasks (does that ring a bell, developers?). Later, thanks to automation and digitalization, people had to increase their knowledge of the systems and manage them as engineers.\n\nIn a few years, AI agents will take over most engineering jobs. Nevertheless, we will still need to stay close to the #business to #understand it and provide proper instructions to the robots (unless they find a way to make money on their own, which I believe is very unlikely).\n\nThis disruption will extend not only to #engineers but also to #managers and all kinds of administrative human employees.\n\nAs a countermeasure, many new #regulations will likely emerge, creating jobs focused on managing these AI systems more securely.\n\nAfter all, we invented Agile, Jira, and other tools that created new roles focused on managing developers. We couldn’t fully understand how software development worked or how to make software #products. If history repeats itself, the same will happen with AI.\n\nThis makes me think:\n\nDoes our inability to fully understand AI’s capabilities will save our jobs in the future? (or maybe I’m just being overly optimistic).\n\nAnyway, our children will figure it out.\n\nAnd we’ll all watch as a new world unfolds 🍿",

        "text": "I wonder what the job market will look like for our children as AI becomes ubiquitous in the next few years 🤔\n\nHistory gives us some clues. In factories, there were production lines, so manual workers were hands-on doing repetitive tasks (does that ring a bell developers?). Later, thanks to #automation and digitalization, people had to increase their knowledge of the systems and manage them as engineers.\n\nIn a few years, AI #agents could take over most engineering jobs. Nevertheless, we will still need to stay close to the business to understand it and give proper instructions to the robots (unless they find a way to make money on their own, which I believe is very unlikely).\n\nThis #disruption will spread not only to engineers but also to managers and all kinds of administrative human employees.\n\nAs a countermeasure, many new regulations will emerge, creating jobs focused on managing these AI systems in a more secure way.\n\nAfter all, we invented Agile, Jira, and other tools that created new #jobs focused on managing developers (cause businesses couldn’t fully understand how software development works or how to make software products). If history repeats itself, the same will happen with AI.\n\nThis makes me think:\n\nMaybe our inability to fully understand AI’s capabilities will save our jobs in the future (or maybe I’m just being overly optimistic).\n\nAnyway, our children will figure it out. \n\nAnd we’ll all watch how a new world unfolds 🍿",

Unlike traditional ML, where you might verify whether an email is spam or not, today’s AI might summarize a book or write a poem. The result looks coherent, but is it accurate? Often, you need to dive deep to assess quality, making evaluation a silent yet formidable bottleneck.\"\n\nAs engineers, I think we’ll spend much more time creating evaluation metrics that align technical performance with business impact, rather than fine-tuning parameters for our AI models.\n\nAI testers will be in great demand in the near future.\n\nAfter all, if we can’t measure success, how can we deliver it?\n\nLink to the podcast interview with Chip Huyen → https://lnkd.in/drmA3Mgu",

I like the soft one from (brand) with the stamped roses.\nAI: Would you like to add it to your shopping list?\n(Meanwhile, some sensitive training data is subtly sent to the cloud…)\n\n2️⃣ AI learning through interaction with the environment\n\nExample ↓\nAI Robot: My entropy parameters suggest I should try something new. What happens if I drop this glass?\nHuman: Hey! Why did you do that? $%&*$%!\nAI (thinking): Dropping a glass from a table elicits strong emotional reactions from humans… (Some more training data finds its way to the cloud server).\n\nThrough conversational AI and real-time feedback, models can evolve dynamically.

For example, when I was a teenager, I didn’t fully grasp the true importance of active learning and honestly didn’t know what I wanted to do (I bet many of you felt the same). I studied anyway, maybe because I had plenty of free time, but I wasn’t entirely convinced it would lead ANYWHERE.\n\nLater, I started following my path, but I was WAITING for opportunities to show up. I had a plan and was working toward it, but deep down, I was more reliant on hope than action.\n\nToday, I see opportunities EVERYWHERE. In fact, there are far too many of them in this digital world. That’s why I’m baffled when I hear people my age complain about a lack of opportunities.\n\nFor me, the real challenge isn’t finding opportunities, it’s managing the paradox of choice: How do I #invest my limited #time in the most rewarding one? Because everything has an opportunity cost.\n\nHave you ever thought about this?\n\nPS: This paradox of choice is a concept popularized by psychologist Barry Schwartz in his book “The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less.” The core idea is that while having some choice is essential for autonomy and well-being, too much choice can lead to decreased happiness and increased regret.",

Then ask yourself:\n\n→ What made it succeed?\n→ What caused it to fail?\n\nI apply this technique when writing, as it allows me to uncover blind spots I didn’t even realize existed. Not only does it force me to #confront hidden #assumptions and #anticipate potential #roadblocks, but it also clarifies the key factors that could propel the task forward. It saves time and resources while instilling clarity and confidence.\n\nYou can try it yourself right now. Ready?

It came into effect last Friday, January 17th, 2025 (yes, politicians deploy on Fridays 🤯). DORA pushes financial entities across the EU to meet stricter #standards to stay #resilient against #cyberattacks and ICT #disruptions. 💻⚡\n\nIf you work in the FinTech sector, DORA is a big deal because:\n\n🔒 It enforces robust risk management frameworks to protect systems from breaches and outages.\n📢 It mandates that firms must report major ICT incidents quickly to tackle threats head-on.\n🎯 Expect rigorous operational stress tests, including threat-led penetration testing.\n🤝 It’s not just banks and financial firms; cloud providers and other ICT vendors must meet compliance too.\n\nFor financial institutions 🏦, adapting to DORA is a massive #commitment, perhaps comparable in scale to MiFID and GDPR. A crucial part of this is identifying critical software functions and their dependencies on third-party vendors(ranging from tech giants to smaller SaaS providers). Aligning all these parties with DORA is challenging but necessary to ensure the availability of critical services, even in the face of large-scale cyberattacks.\n\nFor developers 🧑‍💻, this means more job #opportunities in the financial industry and a growing demand for enhanced resilience into every software solution we build (i.e., setting stronger security protocols, seamless collaboration with risk teams, and designing systems that can handle critical disruptions in real time).\n\nDORA is not just about compliance, it's a commitment, and a call to action to create a more secure financial ecosystem with operational resilience! 🚀",

        "text": "How can you become economically successful as a female magician?\n\nThis was the question that caught my attention today while attending the event titled “Meeting the A-Players: The Art of Pivoting Your Industry.” The question was directed to Caroline Ravn, one of the most #successful professional female magicians in the world 🪄\n\nHer response was both #powerful and #inspiring. She emphasized the importance of fully believing in who you want to become and wholeheartedly embracing that identity. She said (to herself) at some point in her career: “I’m going to be THE magician girl in a suit and heels, and I’m also going to educate others on how to win the business game as an entertainer.”\n\nShe also highlighted the value of personal branding in the business world, explaining that “people start to associate you with positive vibes.” One practical tip she shared was to practice power posing for at least two minutes daily (a small habit with a big psychological #impact).\n\nI had an amazing time today with such a wonderful crowd of Swedish entrepreneurs. I learned so much from people who are pushing the boundaries of #creativity and #innovation. As someone put it: “Entrepreneurship is sometimes like building a plane while flying it.” Challenging? Absolutely. But extremely rewarding as well 🦄\n\nP.S. Caroline wrote a book titled \"The Business Side Of Show Business: How To Make A Living Doing Magic\" (you can check out the link in the last picture below, it's good stuff 😉).",

        "text": "What was the biggest challenge you faced during your PhD? What would you have done differently?\n\nThese were two questions I received from first-year #WASP PhD students yesterday at the WASP Winter Conference in Norrköping. I feel incredibly fortunate for the opportunity to be on stage sharing my #experiences and #insights with such talented students!\n\nThese were my answers: \n\n1️⃣ My biggest challenge:\n“The hardest part was finding the right balance between working really hard on my PhD (doing a PhD is inherently tough) without compromising my health and avoiding burnout. For me, the real challenge wasn’t working hard, it was actually knowing when was the right time to stop working and take a pause.”\n\n2️⃣ What I’d do differently: \n“I regret not planning earlier (at least a year in advance) for what comes after completing the PhD. It’s common among PhD students to get so deeply immersed in the thing that they forget about everything else, because the PhD becomes part of their identity. But graduating isn’t the end of the journey, it’s just the beginning. I recommend start preparing for the next phase before the whirlwind of thesis writing, and the chaos of those final months hits!”\n\nThese are just my personal insights, and every PhD journey is unique… that’s what makes it such a special experience!\n\nI’m grateful for the opportunity to share my stories and engage with #excellent students who will surely become successful researchers and innovators. Many thanks to the WASP – Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program for making this opportunity possible and the dream a reality for so many, and thanks to #Sweden for making research a strategic priority for the benefit of the whole society 😊",

I don’t know where they come from, but they remind me of the ones I used to plant and harvest with my grandpa on his farm when I was a child 🧑‍🌾. The difference in flavor between organic carrots and those grown using industrial procedures is huge!\n\nBTW, here are a couple of fun curiosities about carrots:\n\n☢️ There’s a belief that carrots can help reduce radiation in the human body. This is due to their high levels of antioxidants, especially beta-carotene, which help protect cells from oxidative damage. While carrots don't \"remove\" radiation, their antioxidants might assist in mitigating some cellular damage caused by radiation exposure.\n\n💦 Despite being firm and crunchy, carrots are made up mostly of water. This makes them an excellent hydrating snack, perfect for when you're on the go!\n\nP.S. Supplying fruits and veggies to employees is a common practice in #Sweden, and it’s something I truly appreciate 💯, big thanks to Sweden for the great healthy culture!",

        "text": "I still hear some developers referring to #AI as a #threat.\n\nWhile undeniably useful, current AI models have notable limitations in the context of software development.\n\nHere are my 3 favorites:\n\n1️⃣ Lack of Contextual Understanding: AI lacks the domain expertise and intuition required to assess edge cases or fully grasp the implications of design decisions.\n\n2️⃣ Limited Creativity: While AI can recombine existing elements in unexpected ways, its “creativity” stems from probabilistic reasoning, not from subjective experience, intentionality, or insight.\n\n3️⃣ No Accountability: Software projects don’t live in isolation, they exist to solve real-world problems. An engineer must account for business needs, user behavior, and technical feasibility, which requires human judgment and responsibility.\n\nSo, will AI replace software developers?\n\nI don't think so (at least not anytime soon). But it is fundamentally changing the development landscape, making human creativity and problem-solving capabilities more essential than ever.\n\nAdaptability is one of the most valuable human skills. As long as the world keeps changing, there will always be a need for people who can pivot quickly and come up with creative solutions to the most challenging problems.\n\nIt’s winter now ❄️. I wrote a blog post on this topic during the summer last year 🌞 (link down below), and my thoughts remain unchanged.\n\nAm I wrong?",

        "text": "Just before starting every new year, I do two exercises that help me  focus on what’s important and to achieve my personal goals:\n\n1️⃣ “Wheel of Life”\n\nI draw 3 lines intersecting at the center of an imaginary circle to divide it into 8 sections. Each line represents one of the following areas of life: money, family and friends, fun, career, personal growth, health, love, and giving.\n\nI rate my satisfaction in each area on a visual scale by marking dots along the radius of each section. Then, I connect the dots to form a shape within the circle.\n\nThe resulting shape gives a visual representation of how \"balanced\" I feel in life. The parts of the shape that are uneven highlight areas where I should focus more attention to improve in the coming year.\n\nI compare the current shape with the previous year’s shape and reflect on what has improved and what has declined during that time.\n\n2️⃣ “New Year Goals”\n\nI start by revisiting the past year’s goals and thinking about new goals to improve the current status of my “Wheel of Life” (from exercise 1).\n\nI divide a piece of paper into four quadrants, each representing a quarter of the coming year.\n\nThen, I write no more than 4 goals in each quadrant, following the SMART framework (i.e., Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).\n\nFor example, instead of writing “Getting X certification from Google,” I write “Studying 4 hours every week to get X certification from Google.”\n\nI have found that setting smaller goals that are achievable every 3 months works better for me than having bigger yearly goals. The reason is that one year is too much time, and I tend to forget the goals. I also need that dopamine hit that comes just after achieving each goal.\n\n🆕 in 2025, I want to try out the following 3 new productivity hacks:\n\n- Daily focus log (i.e., write down the amount of time I actually focused during the day).\n\n- Weekly review (i.e., spend 15 minutes every Sunday afternoon to look at the status of my quarter and review how it is going).\n\n- Slowing down (i.e., relax more and lower down my expectations of what I can actually achieve during a short period of time). \n\nFootnote: Numerous studies have shown that writing these things on a piece of paper significantly increases the chances of achieving them.\n\nPS: I you have kids, then you know what the drawings on the back are 😄",

        "text": "Yesterday, I attended an insightful PyData Meetup in Stockholm, hosted by Solita. Very good discussions there, with highly skilled Data Scientists and hands-on community members.\n\nBelow my thoughts on the 2 talks of the day:\n\n1️⃣ \"How LLMs work?\" by Jonas Thunberg\n\n→ Understanding embeddings is essential: LLMs use multi-head self-attention to determine which vector embedding aligns best in the vector space. This involves leveraging previous words' semantic (more embeddings!) to develop an abstract understanding of the text’s meaning.\n\n→ Matrices are everywhere: The fundamental math behind all this stuff is basic operations over matrices and in particular matrix multiplication (that's why GPUs are so expensive nowadays).\n\n🤔 I have a question for companies:\n\n→ Do you seek for experts who truly understand the intricate math behind these technologies, or do you prefer speed and practical skills for rapid deployment instead?\n\n2️⃣\"Building RAG for Financial Data\" by Dmitrii Shiriaev\n\n→ RAG is probably the most applicable AI approach for companies at the moment. It requires \"knowing\" and applying many tricks to accurately extract insights from data to enhance search capabilities (e.g., parsing double-column PDFs, or decoding figures to answer specific business questions). So, it looks to me that \"Data Scientist\" are now turned into \"Search Scientists\".\n\n→ The RAG community lacks open resources to learn the best tricks out there. We still have Kaggle for traditional ML knowledge sharing (e.g., for fine tuning models), but current RAG knowledge is mostly empirical, driven by hands-on experimentation with messy corporate internal data.\n\n🤔 One thought on this:\n\n→ Many companies are cautious about deploying RAG solutions directly to customers due to potential risks of losing credibility and prestige if some responses are wrong. Building trust in these technologies is still WIP. But we'll get there soon.\n\nHave a great weekend folks!\n\nPS: Many thanks to Sebastian Wallkötter, Ph.D. for arranging and coordinating the event.",

Machine Learning) has already proven its worth in production: it's fast, accurate, and reliable.\n\n2️⃣ Generative AI (a.k.a. \"Intelligent Systems\", sort to speak) has incredible potential but still faces limitations.\n\n3️⃣ The synergy between GenAI and ML unlocks exciting new possibilities, driving better customer services and allowing smarter business decisions.\n\nPS: Many thanks to SEB for always supporting developers and giving me the opportunity to share my perspective about tech, science, and beyond 😊\n\n#SEB #SEBTechDay #AI #FutureOfBanking",

There were top-notch presentations, demos, and a well-moderated Q&A session at the end (not to mention the fantastic boat trip across Stockholm's archipelago).\n\nHere are 3 nuggets from the meta-discussion that I still remember:\n\n1. Q: Is choosing a dedicated database always the best option? A: It's important to select a database that best fits the requirements of each specific use case. However, there’s always a trade-off regarding how much versatility is sacrificed in exchange for performance and vice versa.\n\n2. Q: To what extent does it make sense for an organization to pursue a multi-cloud strategy? A: It enhances resilience, avoids vendor lock-in, and optimizes costs across various services. However, spreading resources across multiple clouds also increases complexity, requiring additional expertise and human talent to manage it effectively.\n\n3. Q: What are proven ways to leverage AI as a key driver for tech transformation in the financial sector? A: AI has shown to be a workhorse in the sector, inc. predictive analytics, automating routine processes, and enhancing customer experiences through personalized services. However, it’s not a silver bullet, particularly when it comes to building trust and ensuring the reliability of customer-facing services.\n\nMany thanks to Joakim Karlsson for the invitation 🙂",

Now I know that building an awesome résumé takes time, effort, and conscious planning.\n\nIt reminds me of the \"attributes\" of a character in an RPG video game. In these games, the character's skills increase over time by \"leveling up\" and progressing to the next level. Similarly, in real life, enhancing a résumé is a step-by-step process that can only be achieved by gaining experience.\n\nI wrote a blog post about what (I believe) makes a computer scientist's résumé stand out.\n\nIt all comes down to three things:\n\n1. Simplicity\n2. Solidity\n3. Uniqueness\n\nThese attributes shine when we focus on the right skills, qualities, and passions.\n\n#cv #career #building",

        "text": "🌐 The web is (arguably) the only tech platform that has been continuously transformed and evolved at a global scale over the last 30 years. How was this possible? What can we learn from the past technical mistakes and successes? \n\nMy latest blog post addresses these questions, with a focus on the engineering paradigms that marked inflection points in web history. \n\nHere is a summary of my observations:\n\n📄 Simplicity and Efficiency Holds: Foundational web technologies like static HTML and server-side rendering remain useful for delivering content that rarely changes or doesn't require dynamic processing. These technologies were great in the 90s and continue to be effective and cost-efficient solutions even in 2024 for many use cases.\n\n🎨 User Experience Matters: From the introduction of CSS for enhanced web aesthetics to the development of SPAs for dynamic user interactions, the focus on improving user experience has led to the creation of more dynamic technologies for real-time DOM manipulation and improved data fetching, leading to better user experience.\n\n⚡ Interactivity and Real-Time Communication Are Essential: Technologies such as client-side rendering, AJAX, and WebSockets have redefined user engagement, providing experiences as smooth and responsive as those of desktop applications.\n\n🛡️ Security and Performance Are Continuous Priorities: Technologies like WebAssembly offer robust security models and enhanced performance, enabling developers to create high-performant applications with improved security features.\n\n🚀 Innovation and Adaptability is Not Optional: Developers need to remain flexible and embrace new technologies like WebAssembly and dApps to create cutting-edge web applications that meet the expectations of modern users.\n\n\"Those who don't know tech history are doomed to repeat past engineering mistakes.\"\n\nRead more down below 👇\n\n#WorldWideWeb #WebHistory #WebTechnologies",

        "text": "Live coding in front of an audience is a lot of fun! 🍿. Last Friday, I had a great time coding hand-in-hand with GitHub Copilot at the SEB theater 👨🏼‍💻. It's really cool to see how this wonderful tech allows us to build and run a simple transaction assessment app from scratch... in just 12 minutes! 🚀\n\n🌟 Here are my three favorite features of Copilot:\n1. Seamless IDE integration\n2. Context-aware suggestions\n3. Versatility across engineering roles\n\nHowever, it has some limitations as well:\n1. Occasionally relies on outdated information\n2. Raises some security and privacy concerns\n3. Sometimes generates less efficient code\n\n🤖 Copilot is a fantastic tool that boosts developer productivity. However, it's important not to forget that we are (at least for now) still **The Pilots**! 😄\n\nWhat are your thoughts on using AI tools for coding?\n\n[*] \"Nothing beats watching another developer sweat over something!\" — a comment from a colleague after watching my live coding session.\n\n—\n\n👇 The picture below captured the moment when I was expecting to get a grep regex from Copilot CLI but got a shell command instead due to a typo in my prompt 😂. Takeaway: You should know exactly what you’re asking for 🧠. \n\n#SEB #SEBTech #AI",

It's all about the choices we make as a society. In any case, AI is already here, it's not going anywhere, and it's inevitable.\n\nThe article below reflects my perspective on this matter and outlines where I believe current advances in AI are taking us.\n\n#ai #reflections #blogpost",

SBOMs are essential for software supply chain security.\n2. SBOMs are increasingly getting attention and adoption.\n3. SBOMs are well supported in the Java ecosystem.\n\nMany thanks to the organizers of Jfokus for the opportunity to share my insights on SBOMs at such an excellent conference. My gratitude also extends to my esteemed colleagues from SEB for their unwavering support. A special shoutout to Göran Ramsfeldt, Martin Blixt, and Matilda Nordquist for their encouragement. Speaking at Jfokus was not only an honor but a truly enjoyable experience ❤️.\n\n#jfokus  #speaker  #java  #software  #seb",

A truly magnificent event from start to finish ✨\n\nI think one very special thing that conferences offer us is the opportunity to meet the tech superstars in person! Talking with the people who shape the technologies we work with and love every day is a very unique experience. For example, I had the opportunity to ask Thomas Wuerthinger about the implementation details of his submission to win \"The One Billion Row Challenge\" [1]. Moments like these are simply irreplaceable 🚀\n\nMany thanks to the organizers for all their hard work and dedication in making Jfokus a tremendous success. I'm already counting down the days until next year's edition! Let's keep the spirit of innovation and the Java community forever alive ☕️\n\n[1] https://lnkd.in/ds6bY-rJ\n\n#Jfokus2024 #JavaCommunity #Success",

Back then, I didn't fully grasp the large scale and impact of this amazing research program. \n\nThe memories I've from the friends made, to the trips enjoyed, the courses completed, and the events attended... will stay with me forever.\n\nThank you so much to the WASP – Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program! This initiative has brought opportunities to many Ph.D. students all over the world. We have had the honor of pursuing \"excellent research and developing competence in artificial intelligence, autonomous systems and software for the benefit of Swedish society and industry.\"\n\nI'll keep contributing to this endeavor as much as I can 🚀\n\n#WASP #sweden #researchopportunity",

        "text": "Now is a good time to reflect upon my professional achievements in 2023.\n\nHere are some of my highlights from the year gone by:\n\n* Completed my PhD. I successfully delivered and defended my PhD thesis at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. This is a significant milestone for me after 5 years of dedicated research efforts.\n\n* Landed a great job at SEB. After about 30 job applications, 10 interviews, and a few attractive offers, I happily joined SEB. Now I’m convinced that I made the right choice. \n\n* Got a paper accepted at IEEE TSE. I submitted a research paper that got accepted in the journal  Transactions on Software Engineering. This achievement marked a peak in my research career.\n\n* Engaged with the tech community. I attended over 10 technical meetups in Stockholm. This allowed me to connect with the tech community while visiting companies such as Google, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Spotify, Cloudera, Goldman Sachs,  Combient, and more. I also contributed as a volunteer at Jfokus. \n\n* Expanded my online presence. I wrote 10 blog posts on my website, spoke at 4 events, and was featured in a podcast episode for the first time.\n\n* Kept learning. I improved my Swedish significantly, completed 3 specializations on Coursera, read around 10 technical books, and listened to all episodes of the \"Lex Friedman Podcast\" and \"Software Engineering Radio.\"\n\n* Committed to fitness. I maintained a steady gym routine, hitting the gym at least 5 times a week, and ran the Blodomloppet Sverige (10km Stockholm’s half marathon). There is no professional growth without good health, which for me means going to the gym regularly 😀\n\nFor the next year, my professional focus is to create more technical content (inc. source code) and consume less content in general. \n\nWishing everyone a Happy New Year! Let's make 2024 a year of growth and achievement.\n\n#highlights2023 #newyear2024  #happynewyear #newyearresolution",

If your answer is \"yes\", think twice because most people don't.\n\nTo answer this question, the idea of building Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) has recently emerged as a key concept to enable principled engineering of software supply chains. It extends the well-established concept of a \"bill of materials\", used in manufacturing physical goods, to the realm of software development. The purpose of SBOMs is to capture relevant information about the internals of a software artifact. This includes a complete inventory of all the third-party dependencies of the artifact and its build environment. Thus, answering the question regarding third-party code provenance.\n\nWhether you’re a Java security expert or just starting your journey to deploy robust software solutions, this session is for you. We'll delve into checksums, hierarchy, reproducibility, and production steps for SBOM producers. Let's unleash the benefits of using SBOMs to harden the software supply chain of real-world #Java projects! \n\nMore info and registration: buff.ly/3Sd3GjR",

The AI revolution is already here, and it's inevitable.\n2. It is radically disrupting the job market, especially for developers.\n3. To stay relevant, we must acquire the right skills and navigate this new landscape as best we can.\n4. My best bet is to focus more on the human side of the software business.\n5.
