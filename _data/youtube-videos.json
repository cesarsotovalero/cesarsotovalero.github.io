      "description": "LLMs and optimization are not the same thing (planning, scheduling, NP-hard search, and why ChatGPT-style models fail without solvers like CP-SAT, CPLEX, or MiniZinc).\n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions in AI right now is that Large Language Models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) can solve real optimization and planning problems. They can talk about solutions. That’s not the same as finding one.\n\nPlanning problems (employee rostering, routing, timetabling, job-shop scheduling) live in a different universe from next-token prediction. They are NP-hard, combinatorial, and require search and constraints, not linguistic guesswork.\n\nYou’ll learn:\n→ Why LLMs fail at planning tasks (and often confidently return invalid schedules)\n→ Why “reasoning models” still collapse under combinatorial explosion\n→ What tools are actually built for optimization (mathematical programming, constraint solvers, meta-heuristics)\n→ Where CPLEX, MiniZinc, Timefold (and similar tools) fit in the real stack\n→ How to build hybrid systems where the LLM structures the problem and the solver does the heavy lifting\n\nThis is for software engineers, ML engineers, and AI builders who want to ship systems that work in production (and avoid the hype trap of using language models as generic problem solvers).\n\n👉 Subscribe for more: https://www.youtube.com/@cesarsotovalero?sub_confirmation=1\n\n⏰ TIMESTAMPS \n00:00 Intro \n01:50 What a planning problem really is \n04:29 What traditional optimization does differently \n06:45 Why LLMs break down on planning tasks \n13:31 The Hybrid Approach (LLM + Solver) \n15:25 When to use which tool\n\n📺 RESOURCES\n→ Related video (1): https://youtu.be/Hd04NJej9iE\n→ Related video (2): https://youtu.be/3s7xjI3g73w\n→ Related video (3): https://youtu.be/n1t3XEAyUgQ\n\n#ArtificialIntelligence #LLM #Optimization #OperationsResearch #ConstraintProgramming #Scheduling #SystemDesign #SoftwareEngineering",

        "title": "Why LLMs Can’t Solve Complex Planning Problems",
        "description": "LLMs and optimization are not the same thing (planning, scheduling, NP-hard search, and why ChatGPT-style models fail without solvers like CP-SAT, CPLEX, or MiniZinc).\n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions in AI right now is that Large Language Models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) can solve real optimization and planning problems. They can talk about solutions. That’s not the same as finding one.\n\nPlanning problems (employee rostering, routing, timetabling, job-shop scheduling) live in a different universe from next-token prediction. They are NP-hard, combinatorial, and require search and constraints, not linguistic guesswork.\n\nYou’ll learn:\n→ Why LLMs fail at planning tasks (and often confidently return invalid schedules)\n→ Why “reasoning models” still collapse under combinatorial explosion\n→ What tools are actually built for optimization (mathematical programming, constraint solvers, meta-heuristics)\n→ Where CPLEX, MiniZinc, Timefold (and similar tools) fit in the real stack\n→ How to build hybrid systems where the LLM structures the problem and the solver does the heavy lifting\n\nThis is for software engineers, ML engineers, and AI builders who want to ship systems that work in production (and avoid the hype trap of using language models as generic problem solvers).\n\n👉 Subscribe for more: https://www.youtube.com/@cesarsotovalero?sub_confirmation=1\n\n⏰ TIMESTAMPS \n00:00 Intro \n01:50 What a planning problem really is \n04:29 What traditional optimization does differently \n06:45 Why LLMs break down on planning tasks \n13:31 The Hybrid Approach (LLM + Solver) \n15:25 When to use which tool\n\n📺 RESOURCES\n→ Related video (1): https://youtu.be/Hd04NJej9iE\n→ Related video (2): https://youtu.be/3s7xjI3g73w\n→ Related video (3): https://youtu.be/n1t3XEAyUgQ\n\n#ArtificialIntelligence #LLM #Optimization #OperationsResearch #ConstraintProgramming #Scheduling #SystemDesign #SoftwareEngineering"

      "description": "Will AI replace software engineers (LLMs, coding assistants, real-world development work, and what humans still uniquely do) beyond the headlines and hype.\n\nAI systems are getting scary-good at cognitive tasks, and LLMs can write code fast. So are software engineering jobs actually at risk, or is this another wave of sensational headlines flattening a complex reality?\n\nIn this video, we unpack what “software engineering” really is (beyond typing code), where AI genuinely helps in day-to-day development, and where it still falls short when the work demands creativity, judgment, ownership, and attention to the small human details that make systems usable and safe.\n\nYou’ll learn:\n→ What the headlines get wrong about “AI replacing engineers”\n→ The essence of software engineering (and why code is the easy part)\n→ Where AI helps today (implementation, refactoring, docs, tests, debugging support)\n→ Where AI still struggles (ambiguity, trade-offs, product context, accountability)\n→ Whether juniors are more exposed (and how to become “AI-leveraged” instead)\n→ Practical ways to use AI as a force multiplier without losing engineering rigor\n\nThis is for developers, students, tech leads, and anyone anxious about the future of coding who wants a grounded view of AI’s real capabilities (and a strategy that doesn’t rely on denial or panic).\n\n👉 Subscribe for more: https://www.youtube.com/@cesarsotovalero?sub_confirmation=1\n\n📺 RESOURCES\n→ Watch next: https://youtu.be/DqL3-bnSCy0\n→ Companion blog post: https://www.cesarsotovalero.net/blog/why-genai-will-not-replace-software-engineers-just-yet.html\n→ Blog post (Brainhub): https://brainhub.eu/library/software-developer-age-of-ai\n\n⏰ TIMESTAMPS\n0:00 - AI’s impact on software engineering\n02:20 - Sensational headlines and misconceptions\n05:34 - The essence of software engineering\n09:19 - The value in the small human details\n12:12 - Can AI fully replace software engineers?\n14:23 - How AI can help in software engineering\n16:16 - Can AI replace junior engineers?\n18:12 - Final thoughts\n\n#AI #SoftwareEngineering #AIVsEngineers #TechCareer #AICoding #Developers #FutureOfWork #LLM",

        "description": "Will AI replace software engineers (LLMs, coding assistants, real-world development work, and what humans still uniquely do) beyond the headlines and hype.\n\nAI systems are getting scary-good at cognitive tasks, and LLMs can write code fast. So are software engineering jobs actually at risk, or is this another wave of sensational headlines flattening a complex reality?\n\nIn this video, we unpack what “software engineering” really is (beyond typing code), where AI genuinely helps in day-to-day development, and where it still falls short when the work demands creativity, judgment, ownership, and attention to the small human details that make systems usable and safe.\n\nYou’ll learn:\n→ What the headlines get wrong about “AI replacing engineers”\n→ The essence of software engineering (and why code is the easy part)\n→ Where AI helps today (implementation, refactoring, docs, tests, debugging support)\n→ Where AI still struggles (ambiguity, trade-offs, product context, accountability)\n→ Whether juniors are more exposed (and how to become “AI-leveraged” instead)\n→ Practical ways to use AI as a force multiplier without losing engineering rigor\n\nThis is for developers, students, tech leads, and anyone anxious about the future of coding who wants a grounded view of AI’s real capabilities (and a strategy that doesn’t rely on denial or panic).\n\n👉 Subscribe for more: https://www.youtube.com/@cesarsotovalero?sub_confirmation=1\n\n📺 RESOURCES\n→ Watch next: https://youtu.be/DqL3-bnSCy0\n→ Companion blog post: https://www.cesarsotovalero.net/blog/why-genai-will-not-replace-software-engineers-just-yet.html\n→ Blog post (Brainhub): https://brainhub.eu/library/software-developer-age-of-ai\n\n⏰ TIMESTAMPS\n0:00 - AI’s impact on software engineering\n02:20 - Sensational headlines and misconceptions\n05:34 - The essence of software engineering\n09:19 - The value in the small human details\n12:12 - Can AI fully replace software engineers?\n14:23 - How AI can help in software engineering\n16:16 - Can AI replace junior engineers?\n18:12 - Final thoughts\n\n#AI #SoftwareEngineering #AIVsEngineers #TechCareer #AICoding #Developers #FutureOfWork #LLM"

We’ll cover what deliberate practice actually means, why copying tutorials feels productive but often isn’t, and how to learn in a way that compounds over months and years.\n\nYou’ll learn:\n→ Why “learn to code in a day” sets you up for fragile skills\n→ The difference between familiarity and competence (and why it tricks you)\n→ How deliberate practice builds real ability (not just motivation)\n→ How learning from other developers accelerates progress the right way\n→ A long-term approach that makes coding feel easier over time\n\nThis is for beginners, self-taught developers, and early-career engineers who feel pressure to “catch up fast” and want a strategy that actually works (without the motivational poster lies).\n\n👉 Subscribe for more: https://www.youtube.com/@cesarsotovalero?sub_confirmation=1\n\n📺 RESOURCES\n→ Watch next (résumé): https://youtu.be/-EYVzXoq15o?si=PtRIuB78ZDc5w9fo\n→ Peter Norvig (Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years): http://norvig.com/21-days.html\n\n⏰ TIMESTAMPS\n00:00 - Introduction\n02:10 - The rush to learn software development\n04:53 - Can we learn to code in a day?\n04:34 - The myth of instant expertise\n11:56 - Why deliberate practice matters\n14:56 - Learning from other developers\n17:35 - Long-term learning approach\n19:01 - Takeaways\n\n#SoftwareEngineering #LearnToCode #Programming #DeliberatePractice #Java #Python #Cpp #CareerAdvice"

      "description": "How to peer-review research papers efficiently and fairly (journal and conference peer-review workflow, quick triage, detailed review, and a practical review template).\n\nOver the last few years, I’ve peer-reviewed 10+ papers for top journals and conferences (and I’ve also been on the receiving end of tough reviews as a PhD student).

It’s usually a workflow problem: starting from a blank page, aiming for perfection too early, and trying to write and edit at the same time.\n\nIn this video, I share the strategies that helped me push through writer’s block during my PhD in Computer Science. We’ll cover how to structure the paper early, write imperfect drafts on purpose, use figures and results to create momentum, and refine later when the raw material actually exists.\n\nYou’ll learn:\n→ A simple structure-first approach to start a research paper faster\n→ How adding figures and results early reduces blank-page paralysis\n→ How to paraphrase recurring content without getting stuck rewriting\n→ Why “draft first, refine later” is a productivity superpower\n→ A practical rule: either write something, or consciously do nothing\n→ Mental tricks that make the finished task feel real (and doable)\n\nThis is for PhD students, researchers, and academic writers who feel stuck in the loop of overthinking, procrastinating, and perfectionism and want a repeatable way to keep moving.\n\n👉 Subscribe for more: https://www.youtube.com/@cesarsotovalero?sub_confirmation=1\n\n📺 RESOURCES\n→ Companion blog post: https://www.cesarsotovalero.net/blog/how-i-overcome-writer-block-when-preparing-a-research-paper.html\n→ Nature interview/article: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02013-4\n→ Simon Peyton Jones (How to write a great research paper): https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/write-great-research-paper\n\n⏰ TIMESTAMPS\n00:00 - My struggle with writer's block\n01:38 - Structuring a research paper\n04:30 - Adding figures and results\n08:22 - Paraphrasing recurrent content\n11:10 - Refining and editing later\n12:35 - Either writing or doing nothing\n14:41 - Imagining the finished task\n17:40 - It's just a draft :)\n\n#WritersBlock #PhDLife #AcademicWriting #ResearchPapers #WritingTips #GradSchool #Productivity #ScientificWriting",

We’ll cover how to structure the paper early, write imperfect drafts on purpose, use figures and results to create momentum, and refine later when the raw material actually exists.\n\nYou’ll learn:\n→ A simple structure-first approach to start a research paper faster\n→ How adding figures and results early reduces blank-page paralysis\n→ How to paraphrase recurring content without getting stuck rewriting\n→ Why “draft first, refine later” is a productivity superpower\n→ A practical rule: either write something, or consciously do nothing\n→ Mental tricks that make the finished task feel real (and doable)\n\nThis is for PhD students, researchers, and academic writers who feel stuck in the loop of overthinking, procrastinating, and perfectionism and want a repeatable way to keep moving.\n\n👉 Subscribe for more: https://www.youtube.com/@cesarsotovalero?sub_confirmation=1\n\n📺 RESOURCES\n→ Companion blog post: https://www.cesarsotovalero.net/blog/how-i-overcome-writer-block-when-preparing-a-research-paper.html\n→ Nature interview/article: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02013-4\n→ Simon Peyton Jones (How to write a great research paper): https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/write-great-research-paper\n\n⏰ TIMESTAMPS\n00:00 - My struggle with writer's block\n01:38 - Structuring a research paper\n04:30 - Adding figures and results\n08:22 - Paraphrasing recurrent content\n11:10 - Refining and editing later\n12:35 - Either writing or doing nothing\n14:41 - Imagining the finished task\n17:40 - It's just a draft :)\n\n#WritersBlock #PhDLife #AcademicWriting #ResearchPapers #WritingTips #GradSchool #Productivity #ScientificWriting"

A part of this growth comes with the addition of new features or bug fixes, while another part is due to useless code that accumulates over time. This phenomenon, known as \"software bloat,\" increases with the practice of reusing software dependencies, which has exceeded the capacity of human developers to efficiently manage them. Software bloat in third-party dependencies presents a multifaceted challenge for application development, encompassing issues of security, performance, and maintenance. To address these issues, researchers have developed software debloating techniques that automatically remove unnecessary code.\n\nDespite significant progress has been made in the realm of software debloating, the pervasive issue of dependency bloat warrants special attention. In this thesis, we contribute to the field of software debloating by proposing novel techniques specifically targeting dependencies in the Java ecosystem. First, we investigate the growth of completely unused software dependencies, which we call \"bloated dependencies.''  We propose a technique to automatically detect and remove bloated dependencies in Java projects built with Maven. We empirically study the usage status of dependencies in the Maven Central repository and remove bloated dependencies in mature Java projects. We demonstrate that once a bloated dependency is detected, it can be safely removed as its future usage is unlikely.\n\nSecond, we focus on dependencies that are only partially used. We introduce a technique to specialize these dependencies in Java projects based on their actual usage. Our approach systematically identifies the subset of functionalities within each dependency that is sufficient to build the project and removes the rest. We demonstrate that our dependency specialization approach can halve the project classes to dependency classes ratio. Last, we assess the impact of debloating projects with respect to client applications that reuse them. We present a novel coverage-based debloating technique that determines which class members in Java libraries and their dependencies are necessary for their clients. Our debloating technique effectively decreases the size of debloated libraries while preserving the essential functionalities required to successfully build their clients.\n\nMy Blog: https://www.cesarsotovalero.net/blog\nMy GitHub: https://github.com/cesarsotovalero\nMy Twitter: https://twitter.com/cesarsotovalero\nMy LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/cesarsotovalero\n\n#phdthesis #computerscience #softwareengineering #softwaredebloating",

The presence of software bloat is an issue for security, for performance, and for maintenance. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique for debloating, which we call coverage-based debloating. We implement the technique for one single language: Java bytecode. We leverage a combination of state-of-the-art Java bytecode coverage tools to precisely capture what parts of a project and its dependencies are used when running with a specific workload. Then, we automatically remove the parts that are not covered to generate a debloated version of the project. We succeed in debloating 211 library versions from a dataset of 94 unique open-source Java libraries. The debloated versions are syntactically correct and preserve their original behavior according to the workload. Our results indicate that 68.3% of the libraries’ bytecode and 20.3% of their total dependencies can be removed through coverage-based debloating.\n\nFor the first time in the literature on software debloating, we assess the utility of debloated libraries concerning client applications that reuse them. We select 988 client projects that either have a direct reference to the debloated library in their source code or which test suite covers at least one class of the libraries that we debloat. Our results show that 81.5% of the clients with at least one test that uses the library successfully compile and pass their test suite when the original library is replaced by its debloated version.\n\nMy Blog: https://www.cesarsotovalero.net/blog\nMy GitHub: https://github.com/cesarsotovalero\nMy Twitter: https://twitter.com/cesarsotovalero\nMy LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/cesarsotovalero\n\n#softwaredebloating #codequality #dependencies",

If you’re on the fence, this will help you think clearly about what a PhD can unlock and what it will demand from you.\n\nYou’ll learn:\n→ How a PhD can feed intellectual curiosity in a structured way\n→ What it takes to become a professional researcher (beyond reading papers)\n→ How PhD life builds a career network that compounds for years\n→ Why the credential can differentiate you (when used strategically)\n→ How the challenge reshapes your confidence and problem-solving\n→ What it means to truly own your work and ideas\n→ How a PhD can increase mobility (including emigrating) through opportunity\n\nThis is for students, software engineers, and early-career professionals considering a PhD in CS who want practical reasons, real trade-offs, and a clearer decision framework.\n\n👉 Subscribe for more: https://www.youtube.com/@cesarsotovalero?sub_confirmation=1\n\n📺 RESOURCES\n→ Companion blog post (7 reasons for a PhD in CS): https://www.cesarsotovalero.net/blog/seven-reasons-to-go-for-a-phd-in-computer-science.html\n\n⏰ TIMESTAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:53 - Feed your intellectual curiosity\n03:54 - Become a professional researcher\n06:41 - Build a career network\n08:50 - Set yourself apart from the competition\n11:05 - Challenge yourself\n12:36 - Own your work\n14:38 - Emigrate!\n17:03 - Outro\n\n#Research #PhDCareer #ComputerScience #PhDLife #AcademicCareer #ResearchSkills #GradSchool #CareerAdvice"

Bloated dependencies are third-party libraries that are packaged in the application binary but are not needed to run the application. We analyze the history of 435 Java projects. This historical data includes 48,469 distinct dependencies, which we study across a total of 31,515 versions of Maven dependency trees. Bloated dependencies steadily increase over time, and 89.2% of the direct dependencies that are bloated remain bloated in all subsequent versions of the studied projects. This empirical evidence suggests that developers can safely remove a bloated dependency. We further report novel insights regarding the unnecessary maintenance efforts induced by bloat.

      "description": "Talk presented at FOSDEM 2021\n\nRead the related paper https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10664-020-09914-8.pdf\nRead more about FOSDEM https://fosdem.org/2021\n\n# Summary \n\nThe talk introduces DepClean, an open-source tool we developed to automatically determine the presence of bloated dependencies in Maven artifacts. DepClean performs a deep static analysis of the dependency network and suggests direct and transitive dependencies to be removed or excluded. Given an application and its build file, DepClean collects the complete dependency tree (the list of dependencies declared in the pom.xml and transitive dependencies) and analyzes the bytecode of the artifact and all its dependencies to determine the presence of bloated dependencies. DepClean also generates a clean variant of the build file in which bloated dependencies are removed.\n\nThis talk focuses on one specific type of software dependency: bloated dependencies. They are libraries packaged with the application's compiled code but not necessary to build and execute the application. In other words, they are libraries declared as dependencies in a build file, which can be removed from the file, and the build still successfully passes. As a consequence of bloated dependencies, the binary file includes more code than necessary. An artificially large binary is an issue when the application is sent over the network (e.g., web applications) or is deployed on small devices (e.g., embedded systems). In addition, bloated dependencies embed vulnerable code that can be exploited while being actually useless for the application. Overall, bloated dependencies needlessly increase the difficulty of managing and evolving software applications.\n\nWe present our analysis of 9639 Java artifacts hosted on Maven Central, including 723444 dependency relationships. Our key result is as follows: 2,7% of the dependencies directly declared are bloated, 15,4% of the inherited dependencies are bloated, and 57% of the transitive dependencies of the studied artifacts are bloated. Based on these results, we distill and discuss two possible causes: the cascade of unwanted transitive dependencies induced by direct dependencies and the multi-module Maven projects' dependency heritage mechanism.\n\nOur qualitative assessment of DepClean involves 30 notable open-source projects. For each project, we used DepClean to generate a pom.xml file without bloated dependencies and submitted the changes as a pull request to the project. Notably, our work yielded 21 merged pull requests by open-source developers, and 140 bloated dependencies were removed. In summary, our results indicate that developers pay attention to their dependencies when they are notified of the problem, which stresses the need to engineer, i.e., analyze, maintain, and test POM files.\n\nMy Blog: https://www.cesarsotovalero.net/blog\nMy GitHub: https://github.com/cesarsotovalero\nMy Twitter: https://twitter.com/cesarsotovalero\nMy LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/cesarsotovalero\n\n#softwarebloat #softwaredevelopment #dependencies",
