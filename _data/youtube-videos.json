      "description": "My PhD Defense\nJune 1st, 2023\n\nLink to the full PhD thesis: https://www.cesarsotovalero.net/files/thesis/cesar-fulltext.pdf\nLink to the slides: https://www.cesarsotovalero.net/files/thesis/slides/cesar-phd-defense.pptx\n\n# Summary\n\nSoftware systems have a natural tendency to grow in size and complexity. A part of this growth comes with the addition of new features or bug fixes, while another part is due to useless code that accumulates over time. This phenomenon, known as \"software bloat,\" increases with the practice of reusing software dependencies, which has exceeded the capacity of human developers to efficiently manage them. Software bloat in third-party dependencies presents a multifaceted challenge for application development, encompassing issues of security, performance, and maintenance. To address these issues, researchers have developed software debloating techniques that automatically remove unnecessary code.\n\nDespite significant progress has been made in the realm of software debloating, the pervasive issue of dependency bloat warrants special attention. In this thesis, we contribute to the field of software debloating by proposing novel techniques specifically targeting dependencies in the Java ecosystem. First, we investigate the growth of completely unused software dependencies, which we call \"bloated dependencies.''  We propose a technique to automatically detect and remove bloated dependencies in Java projects built with Maven. We empirically study the usage status of dependencies in the Maven Central repository and remove bloated dependencies in mature Java projects. We demonstrate that once a bloated dependency is detected, it can be safely removed as its future usage is unlikely.\n\nSecond, we focus on dependencies that are only partially used. We introduce a technique to specialize these dependencies in Java projects based on their actual usage. Our approach systematically identifies the subset of functionalities within each dependency that is sufficient to build the project and removes the rest. We demonstrate that our dependency specialization approach can halve the project classes to dependency classes ratio. Last, we assess the impact of debloating projects with respect to client applications that reuse them. We present a novel coverage-based debloating technique that determines which class members in Java libraries and their dependencies are necessary for their clients. Our debloating technique effectively decreases the size of debloated libraries while preserving the essential functionalities required to successfully build their clients.\n\nMy Blog: https://www.cesarsotovalero.net/blog\nMy GitHub: https://github.com/cesarsotovalero\nMy Twitter: https://twitter.com/cesarsotovalero\nMy LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/cesarsotovalero\n\n#phdthesis #computerscience #softwareengineering #softwaredebloating",

      "description": "Presentation at ESEC/FSE 2022.\n\nRead the paper https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3546948\nRead about the ESEC/FSE Conference Journal First Track https://2022.esec-fse.org/track/fse-2022-journal-first#programming \n\n# Summary\n\nSoftware bloat is code that is packaged in an application but is actually not necessary to run the application. The presence of software bloat is an issue for security, for performance, and for maintenance. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique for debloating, which we call coverage-based debloating. We implement the technique for one single language: Java bytecode. We leverage a combination of state-of-the-art Java bytecode coverage tools to precisely capture what parts of a project and its dependencies are used when running with a specific workload. Then, we automatically remove the parts that are not covered to generate a debloated version of the project. We succeed in debloating 211 library versions from a dataset of 94 unique open-source Java libraries. The debloated versions are syntactically correct and preserve their original behavior according to the workload. Our results indicate that 68.3% of the libraries’ bytecode and 20.3% of their total dependencies can be removed through coverage-based debloating.\n\nFor the first time in the literature on software debloating, we assess the utility of debloated libraries concerning client applications that reuse them. We select 988 client projects that either have a direct reference to the debloated library in their source code or which test suite covers at least one class of the libraries that we debloat. Our results show that 81.5% of the clients with at least one test that uses the library successfully compile and pass their test suite when the original library is replaced by its debloated version.\n\nMy Blog: https://www.cesarsotovalero.net/blog\nMy GitHub: https://github.com/cesarsotovalero\nMy Twitter: https://twitter.com/cesarsotovalero\nMy LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/cesarsotovalero\n\n#softwaredebloating #codequality #dependencies",

Bloated dependencies are third-party libraries that are packaged in the application binary but are not needed to run the application. We analyze the history of 435 Java projects. This historical data includes 48,469 distinct dependencies, which we study across a total of 31,515 versions of Maven dependency trees. Bloated dependencies steadily increase over time, and 89.2% of the direct dependencies that are bloated remain bloated in all subsequent versions of the studied projects. This empirical evidence suggests that developers can safely remove a bloated dependency. We further report novel insights regarding the unnecessary maintenance efforts induced by bloat. We find that 22% of dependency updates performed by developers are made on bloated dependencies, and that Dependabot suggests a similar ratio of updates on bloated dependencies.\n\nMy Blog: https://www.cesarsotovalero.net/blog\nMy GitHub: https://github.com/cesarsotovalero\nMy Twitter: https://twitter.com/cesarsotovalero\nMy LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/cesarsotovalero\n\n#softwarebloat #dataanalysis #dependencies",

      "description": "Talk presented at FOSDEM 2021\n\nRead the related paper https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10664-020-09914-8.pdf\nRead more about FOSDEM https://fosdem.org/2021\n\n# Summary \n\nThe talk introduces DepClean, an open-source tool we developed to automatically determine the presence of bloated dependencies in Maven artifacts. DepClean performs a deep static analysis of the dependency network and suggests direct and transitive dependencies to be removed or excluded. Given an application and its build file, DepClean collects the complete dependency tree (the list of dependencies declared in the pom.xml and transitive dependencies) and analyzes the bytecode of the artifact and all its dependencies to determine the presence of bloated dependencies. DepClean also generates a clean variant of the build file in which bloated dependencies are removed.\n\nThis talk focuses on one specific type of software dependency: bloated dependencies. They are libraries packaged with the application's compiled code but not necessary to build and execute the application. In other words, they are libraries declared as dependencies in a build file, which can be removed from the file, and the build still successfully passes. As a consequence of bloated dependencies, the binary file includes more code than necessary. An artificially large binary is an issue when the application is sent over the network (e.g., web applications) or is deployed on small devices (e.g., embedded systems). In addition, bloated dependencies embed vulnerable code that can be exploited while being actually useless for the application. Overall, bloated dependencies needlessly increase the difficulty of managing and evolving software applications.\n\nWe present our analysis of 9639 Java artifacts hosted on Maven Central, including 723444 dependency relationships. Our key result is as follows: 2,7% of the dependencies directly declared are bloated, 15,4% of the inherited dependencies are bloated, and 57% of the transitive dependencies of the studied artifacts are bloated. Based on these results, we distill and discuss two possible causes: the cascade of unwanted transitive dependencies induced by direct dependencies and the multi-module Maven projects' dependency heritage mechanism.\n\nOur qualitative assessment of DepClean involves 30 notable open-source projects. For each project, we used DepClean to generate a pom.xml file without bloated dependencies and submitted the changes as a pull request to the project. Notably, our work yielded 21 merged pull requests by open-source developers, and 140 bloated dependencies were removed. In summary, our results indicate that developers pay attention to their dependencies when they are notified of the problem, which stresses the need to engineer, i.e., analyze, maintain, and test POM files.\n\nMy Blog: https://www.cesarsotovalero.net/blog\nMy GitHub: https://github.com/cesarsotovalero\nMy Twitter: https://twitter.com/cesarsotovalero\nMy LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/cesarsotovalero\n\n#softwarebloat #softwaredevelopment #dependencies",
