{"success":true,"message":"","data":[{"isBrandPartnership":false,"text":"Have you ever had that awkward moment, just after jumping into a new large codebase, when you find everything wild and chaotic?\n\nI know, it‚Äôs hard to avoid thinking: ‚ÄúThis is a mess. How could anyone maintain this stuff?‚Äù\n\nIf you‚Äôve been into software long enough, I‚Äôm 100% sure you‚Äôve had this kind of feeling.\n\nBut over time, I‚Äôve learned something:\n\n‚Ü≥ When really complex systems work for real customers, even if they work imperfectly, that‚Äôs not something to take lightly.\n\nThe very fact that it has worked and survived the test of time is a huge achievement!\n\nBecause complex systems are always messy from the inside out.\n\nSIDE NOTE: You know what I mean, the complexity of software is such a fascinating thing, isn‚Äôt it? üòÅ\n\nThis complexity is the price we pay for solving real problems at scale.\n\nThere‚Äôs no way to escape from it.\n\nWe don‚Äôt eliminate complexity, we just move it around and hide it with abstractions. \n\nThat‚Äôs why I hesitate before touching legacy code that has quietly done its job for years.\n\nNow I only change old, battle-proven code when I absolutely must. Seriously.\n\nIf you're in doubt, remember Chesterton‚Äôs Fence: \n\n‚Ü≥ ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tear down a fence until you understand why it was built.‚Äù\n\nIn other words: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt change what you don‚Äôt understand!‚Äù\n\nI know it's hard this days, with #AI tools, it‚Äôs easier than ever to refactor or rewrite code. The bar to start making changes has lowered down significantly. But there‚Äôs a danger in how quickly we forget why something exists. For example, AI doesn‚Äôt know that a function was built around a legal constraint, a performance hack, or a hard-learned production failure.\n\nMany disasters in software don‚Äôt come from bad intentions. They come from lack of context and/or ignoring history.\n\nNew leaders often arrive, find things ‚Äúuseless‚Äù or ‚Äúbroken,‚Äù and want to delete or change them without appreciating the journey it took other devs to get there.\n\nSo when entering into a new codebase, respect wildlife like a nice guest in your neighbor's house. Because we won‚Äôt be able to fully grasp the intricacies of an ecosystem at the first glance, and that‚Äôs why we tread lightly.\n\nLet me said it again, we should stop pretending complexity can be removed. I've seen so many failed attempts into this direction... I can't count.\n\nLet‚Äôs accept complexity, that‚Äôs all. \n\nGood engineers make sure they understand the past before trying to mess around with the present.\n\nLet‚Äôs respect wildlife, for our own survival! üêü","totalReactionCount":3,"likeCount":3,"postUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7314008685779783680/","shareUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cesarsotovalero_ai-activity-7314008685779783680-T1lF?utm_source=social_share_send\u0026utm_medium=member_desktop_web\u0026rcm=ACoAAFg9AUEBgQuiHVAVYm2L6jyhq9HDD9m3OUE","postedAt":"13h","postedDate":"2025-04-04 19:39:18.4 +0000 UTC","postedDateTimestamp":1743795558400,"urn":"7314008685779783680","author":{"id":512443526,"firstName":"C√©sar","lastName":"Soto Valero","headline":"Data Scientist @ SEB ¬∑ PhD in CS ¬∑ I'm into {Tech ‚à© Science} ¬∑ Living a dream üá∏üá™","username":"cesarsotovalero","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cesarsotovalero","profilePictures":[{"width":200,"height":200,"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D03AQGwkEHGrmV7Sg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/B4DZT6s4SmGkAc-/0/1739372856945?e=1749081600\u0026v=beta\u0026t=Oma0ALAcWk0HyNVGU8ebONB-idpGYjyPnxaSq-DG4QY"},{"width":400,"height":400,"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D03AQGwkEHGrmV7Sg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/B4DZT6s4SmGkAk-/0/1739372856945?e=1749081600\u0026v=beta\u0026t=OUzYsRVIunNxPVCC1AiQl6JKDIHyk8TRWOY9yizsq_M"},{"width":800,"height":800,"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D03AQGwkEHGrmV7Sg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/B4DZT6s4SmGkAg-/0/1739372856945?e=1749081600\u0026v=beta\u0026t=ktSEAj3ULr8Ul6dpiqmmlcXuUzSjbVRhIAXXqF1_gFg"},{"width":100,"height":100,"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D03AQGwkEHGrmV7Sg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_100_100/B4DZT6s4SmGkAY-/0/1739372856928?e=1749081600\u0026v=beta\u0026t=2wrpGdOxunOiUe1FNLSHmo3ZRXkNwKUAMrZJqjfUc_c"}],"urn":"urn:li:fsd_profile:ACoAAB6LRIYBuuTSPSr7cPtObanXlRytHm6YRb8"},"image":[{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQGIcprHZlkqGg/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4DZYCUIcJHsAo-/0/1743795556714?e=1746662400\u0026v=beta\u0026t=1tQz7s49gHCjj2ZjwBTCWIoLF-IDNqpL8oWf01570u4","width":813,"height":1084},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQGIcprHZlkqGg/feedshare-shrink_160/B4DZYCUIcJHsAc-/0/1743795556729?e=1746662400\u0026v=beta\u0026t=pdnp6GkqDkIFhwvBp5dxteo62mekNbZbSMceMX0paQQ","width":160,"height":213},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQGIcprHZlkqGg/feedshare-shrink_480/B4DZYCUIcJHsAY-/0/1743795556729?e=1746662400\u0026v=beta\u0026t=MzoHX5uKJMdAuT5f3UiBpzsH5LYNKp_qs8Lh9_7bo1s","width":480,"height":640},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQGIcprHZlkqGg/feedshare-shrink_800/B4DZYCUIcJHsAg-/0/1743795556729?e=1746662400\u0026v=beta\u0026t=Rw_8Op7pcLiEBkNGUn_4Rjc0oLv1WEhCaIcJ4brdFDk","width":800,"height":1066},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQGIcprHZlkqGg/feedshare-shrink_20/B4DZYCUIcJHsAw-/0/1743795556693?e=1746662400\u0026v=beta\u0026t=O6yHWaIW1aE9r7Zhg3ot-r7pXNAXGj22M9adVBp7hM0","width":20,"height":26},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQGIcprHZlkqGg/feedshare-shrink_1280/B4DZYCUIcJHsAk-/0/1743795556693?e=1746662400\u0026v=beta\u0026t=aJKOM8C6duwnxFHx1x_sEvQLnyyLRVu3EHM5GlNLc5o","width":813,"height":1084}],"company":{},"document":{},"celebration":{},"poll":{},"article":{"newsletter":{}},"entity":{}},{"isBrandPartnership":false,"text":"Many of us once read TAOCP and believed that coding and algorithms were a form of art that couldn‚Äôt be automated.\n\nBut we were wrong.\n\nWhat I once saw as a unique human craft is now the next target for assembly line automation.\n\nTurns out that programming is just advanced pattern-matching, and #LLMs are extremely good at it.\n\n#AI doesn‚Äôt just generate code that runs, it‚Äôs already getting better than most human developers when looking at code quality.\n\nBut I‚Äôm not disillusioned about the future of software engineering, I‚Äôm just waking up to the shift‚Ä¶\n\nBecause this isn‚Äôt just another bump in abstraction, like when we moved from assembly to higher-level PLs, I think it‚Äôs a paradigm shift.\n\nWe‚Äôre no longer writing most code from scratch, and if you still see yourself as a ‚Äúcode writer,‚Äù you‚Äôll be left behind.\n\nI believe the true winners in this new era will be those who understand how software should work, not just how to ‚Äúmake it work once.‚Äù\n\nBecause writing code isn‚Äôt the hard part anymore.

wrong with coding interviews for decades:\n\nIn my 1st year of grad school, I heard about programming contests. They sounded exciting, but I didn‚Äôt solved any problem (I didn't know how to code in 2009).\n\nBy 2nd year, I jumped in, competed in a local ACM-ICPC tournament and got hooked.\n\nNext year, I was solving problem after problem on online judges (got 1,000+ correct submissions) and went to the regionals. It felt like leveling up in a video game.\n\nBut something changed.\n\nThe deeper I went, the more I realized: this wasn‚Äôt fun anymore. It was like ches: to really excel, you have to dedicate your life to it (I love chess, btw). \n\nThat killed the joy.\n\nSo I stepped away.\n\nYears later, I entered the job market, and boom! Coding interviews (especially in big tech) were all about solving those kinds of ADA problems live, under extreme pressure.\n\nIt felt familiar. Too familiar‚Ä¶\n\nBut in this case there's a huge problem:\n\nSolving algorithm puzzles in 45 mins has nothing to do with writing clean, maintainable software in the real world.\n\nWorse, the system is really broken:\n\n‚Ü≥ It rewards people who‚Äôve memorized patterns, not those who solve real problems.\n‚Ü≥ It filters out brilliant engineers who haven‚Äôt ‚ÄúLeetcoded enough.‚Äù\n‚Ü≥ It creates a test that‚Äôs easy to fail.\n\nI understand that this test style is scalable, but I've seen senior engineers with PhDs and successful OSS projects spending weeks practicing LeetCode problems just to get past the first interview screen.\n\nPutting that much energy into riddles wasn‚Äôt that bad 20 years ago. But the world has changed a lot since then.\n\nToday‚Äôs #LLMs can solve most ACM-ICPC problems in seconds.\n\nI don't really see how this could be a good way to test the value of professionals.\n\nToday I read about undetectable apps that feeds GPT-powered answers during LeetCode-style online interviews, like the one created by Roy Lee.\n\nSo the system will collapse under its own weight (at least for its online mode). But honestly... I'm happy about it.\n\nIt‚Äôs finally time to kill programming-contest-style interviews for good.\n\nSo what should we do instead?\n\nHere are some alternatives that I believe actually reflect real skills:\n\n‚Ü≥ Give a real-world business problem. Ask the candidate to design and implement a solution from scratch. Discuss trade-offs, architecture, and impact.\n‚Ü≥ Show messy, buggy, insecure code. Ask what‚Äôs wrong, what‚Äôs risky, and how they‚Äôd fix it.\n‚Ü≥ Give raw data. Ask them to build something that adds or creates business value.\n\nThe whole point should be to simulate the real job. Because the real job lives in the real world. And in the real world, there is #AI, whether we want it or not.\n\nSo, let‚Äôs stop testing people on fantasy skills.\n\nIf you have a different idea, let me know üôÇ\n\nP.S.
