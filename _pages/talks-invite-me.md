# Invite Me to Speak

I'm always grateful for opportunities to share my knowledge and experiences.

If you'd like to have me at your event, feel free to contact me using [this form](../about-me#contact-me).

I don't charge a speaking fee, but I kindly ask that you cover economy-class airfare and accommodation in a decent hotel if the talk is in-person.

**Note:** I'm fine posting promotional content, so I can promote your event on my social network channels if I speak there ðŸ˜‰

Due to limited availability, I canâ€™t accept all invitations.

If Iâ€™m not yet familiar with your event, including the following details in your email will help me better evaluate your request:

- Event details (e.g., name, date, location)
- Audience (e.g., estimated size, technical level)
- Topic/s youâ€™d like me to cover
- Budget for my talk

Looking forward to hearing from you!
