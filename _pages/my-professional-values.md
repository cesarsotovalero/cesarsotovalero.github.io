# Why This Page?

This page outlines the kind of work environment and opportunities Iâ€™m exclusively interested in at the moment.
I wrote it to offer clarity, not just for recruiters and hiring managers, but also as a compass for myself.

# TL;DR

Iâ€™m looking to contribute to impactful and meaningful projects, ideally within a large, established organization (not startups).
My interest lies in research and engineering roles that emphasize innovation, scalability, and real-world impact.

The ideal environment is collaborative, diverse, and inclusive, where I can grow, mentor others, and help solve complex challenges.
While I prefer hybrid work, Iâ€™m open to on-site arrangements if they align with my goals and values.

Iâ€™m not interested in high-paying jobs that lack purpose.
That means no gambling, gaming, ad tech, predatory fintech, or blockchain Ponzi schemes.
I prioritize roles that serve an ethical mission and value emotionally healthy teams over vanity metrics or growth-at-all-costs cultures.

# Engineering and Research

With a PhD in Computer Science, my passion lies in tackling complex, unsolved problems.
In particular, I target real-world problems and like to work hard to provide scalable, efficient, and reliable solutions.
If an AI can solve it out of the box, Iâ€™m not interested.

While I have experience maintaining and improving existing systems, Iâ€™m most energized when building from the ground up.
Thereâ€™s something deeply satisfying about getting a system to work for the first time, especially when it has meaningful impact.

I thrive when working on research prototypes, especially when they have the potential to be used in production.
Iâ€™m ready to take on that journey, provided the organization is willing to invest in the right resources.
In return, I bring a deep commitment to robustness, from debugging obscure edge cases to optimizing critical execution paths.

I also believe in pragmatism over perfection.
Maintenance and iterative development usually outperform full rewrites in the long run.
However, I wonâ€™t shy away from architectural overhauls when evolving requirements demand them.

I prefer working on a focused set of tasks, so I can dive deep into the technical nuances that matter.
This level of focus helps maintain the context needed to produce high-quality, thoughtful work.
And yes, Iâ€™m open to being on-call, as long as I have the autonomy to improve the systems Iâ€™m responsible for.

# Organization and Culture

Iâ€™m looking for an organization that strikes a healthy balance between maturity and agility.
Ideally, it has the structure and resources to support professional growth, while maintaining the autonomy and flexibility needed to innovate.
I have little patience for bureaucracy that slows things down (filing long-winded Jira specs for trivial tasks isnâ€™t how I thrive).

I believe great engineering is a team effort, but above all, I care about the health and longevity of the project.
That means creating a culture where knowledge is open and accessible, enabling smooth knowledge transfer and long-term sustainability.
If the success of the project depends on tribal knowledge or hidden documentation, somethingâ€™s broken.

Mentorship is also central to how I work.
Iâ€™ve found real fulfillment in helping junior engineers and students grow technically, professionally, and sometimes personally.
Working with less experienced team members often forces us to clarify our thinking, improve our processes, and communicate better.
Itâ€™s a win for everyone.

I'm deeply committed to diversity and inclusion.
I want to be part of a team that genuinely values different perspectives and actively supports people from underrepresented backgrounds.
Iâ€™d like to feel confident referring talented individuals to the company, knowing theyâ€™ll be welcomed, respected, and empowered.

And finally, the companyâ€™s mission matters to me.
I want to work somewhere I can ethically stand behind, whether it's improving lives, advancing science, or simply doing no harm.
Iâ€™m not interested in building tech for military weapons, gambling, exploitative finance, or morally questionable applications.

# Management

I believe hierarchies are essential, not because they imply superiority, but because they establish clarity.
Flat structures often sound great on paper, but in practice, they blur accountability and decision-making.
I value knowing who is responsible for what, and how I fit into the bigger picture.

I want to work with a manager who inspires and enables, not just someone who got promoted for technical excellence.
Great management is a distinct skill set, not a consolation prize for senior engineers.
I donâ€™t buy into the idea that engineering teams can self-manage, or that technical brilliance naturally translates into leadership ability.
Managing humans is hard, and doing it well requires both emotional intelligence and a deep understanding of team dynamics.

Iâ€™m looking for a manager who takes an active interest in my growth, someone who gives honest, constructive feedback and helps me navigate my career with intention.
I value clear communication around what the company actually prioritizes and how I can align my work to make the greatest impact.

Regular 1:1s are a must for me.
Monthly is ideal, weekly is welcome, even if theyâ€™re short check-ins.
These meetings are less about micromanagement and more about connection, clarity, and course correction.

# Closing Thoughts

In short, Iâ€™m only interested in roles that align with my technical strengths, ethical values, and desire for continuous growth.
I believe that doing meaningful work.
Serving to something bigger than ourselves is one of the core ingredients of a fulfilling life.

The right role for me emphasizes innovation, scalability, and reliability, all within a supportive and inclusive culture.

If youâ€™ve made it this far, chances are youâ€™re genuinely interested in working with me (I appreciate that).
If you think weâ€™re a good fit, Iâ€™d love to hear from you.
A concrete proposal goes a long way in respecting both of our time.

Have a great day! ðŸ˜Ž
