# Why This Page?

This page outlines the type of work environment and opportunities I'm _only_ interested in ATM.
I wrote it to provide clarity to recruiters, hiring managers, and even myself.

# TL;DR

I would like to work in a place where I can work on impactful and meaningful projects, preferably within a large and established organization (not startups). 
I'm particularly interested in research or engineering roles that focus on innovation, scalability, and real-world impact.
Ideally, the role would be in a collaborative, diverse, and inclusive environment where I can grow, mentor others, and contribute to solving complex problems. 
Remote work is preferred, but I'm open to hybrid opportunities if they align with my goals.

No gambling, gaming, ads, predatory fintech, or blockchain work.
I prioritize ethical missions and value emotionally healthy teams.

# Engineering and Research

With a PhD in Computer Science, my passion lies in solving complex problems that have not been solved before.
In particular, I target real-world problems and like to work hard to provide scalable, efficient, and reliable solutions.

While I have experience improving and maintaining existing systems, I particularly enjoy building systems from the ground up. 
I find something deeply satisfying about making something work for the first time, especially when it has a significant impact.

I thrive when working on research prototypes, especially when they have the potential to be used in production.
I'm ready to take on the challenge of turning a research prototype into a production-ready system, provided the organization is willing to invest in the necessary resources. 
In such a case, I'm deeply committed to ensuring these systems are robust in production.
Whether it involves troubleshooting obscure bugs or optimizing critical paths, I find these challenges exciting and rewarding.

I also value pragmatic approaches to engineering. 
Maintenance and iteration often yield better long-term outcomes than full rewrites, though I'm not opposed to significant architectural changes when they are justified by evolving requirements.

I prefer to deal with a limited set of task to ensure I can focus the attention needed to deeply understand their technical details.
This approach helps maintain the context required for producing consistently high-quality work output.
I welcome being on-call for systems I account for, provided I have the autonomy to make meaningful improvements to their code quality.

# Organization and Culture

I want to work in an organization that balances maturity and agility. 
Ideally, the company should have the resources and structure to support professional growth while maintaining the autonomy to innovate.
Bureaucracy that stifles efficiency, like filing Jira tickets with long specs for simple tasks, is not for me.

I believe teamwork is at the core of great engineering. 
That being said, the most important for me is the health and survival of the project.
Therefore, knowledge about the project should be open and accessible to every engineer, which facilitates effective knowledge transfer and ensures the long-term success of the project.

Mentorship opportunities is another key factor for me.
I've found great joy in guiding less experienced students and practitioners, helping them grow technically and professionally.
I believe that working with junior engineers fosters healthier processes and better communication across teams.

I'm deeply committed to diversity and inclusion (D&I). 
I'd like to work in an environment that values different perspectives and supports individuals from various backgrounds.
I want to feel confident referring to talented individuals from underrepresented groups, knowing they will thrive and be respected.

Finally, the company's mission matters to me.
I'd like to work on a place that I can ethically support, whether they advance society, improve lives, or are at least morally neutral.
I'm not interested in defense, military applications, gambling, or exploitative financial services.

# Management

I think hierarchies are necessary when there is more than one individual. 
Flat structures seem like a myth to me, meaning that I value clear lines of responsibility and accountability.

I want to have a manager who inspires me. 
I value great management skills, and don't trust just someone who was promoted for technical prowess.
I don't believe engineering teams are self-managing, or that good engineers usually make good managers. 
Managing people is hard and requires both technical and non-technical skills.

I'm looking for a manager who actively keep track of my career progression and is honest about my performance. 
I want to feel supported to develop new skills that find alignment between my goals and organizational needs. 
I appreciate a manager that provides clear guidance on what the company actually cares about, and how I can contribute most effectively.

Regular 1:1s with are important to me. 
Monthly meetings are ideal, weekly is also good (even if they're brief).

# Closing Thoughts

In summary, I'm only interested in roles that involve align with my technical expertise, ethical values, and personal growth aspirations.
A focus on innovation, scalability, and reliability within a supportive and inclusive culture would be ideal. 
By working together, I'm confident we can create meaningful and impactful outcomes.

Cheers! ðŸš€
