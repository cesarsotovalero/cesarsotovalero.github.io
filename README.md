This is the source code of [cesarsotovalero.net](https://www.cesarsotovalero.net), my personal website and blog.
The repo contains a mess of HTML templates, Jekyll templates, blog posts and images, so it's been released under a dual license.

This means you're free to copy it, modify it and share it, subject to the following restrictions:

- **Attribution**: You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.

If you find some code on here, you're free to use it for whatever you like.
However, if you want to use any of the articles, images, diagrams or anything else that's not source code, you've got to credit me, you've got to share your changes, and you're not allowed to sell it or use it for anything commercial.

In other words, what is written for computers is dual CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 / MIT licensed, and what is written for humans is CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 only.
